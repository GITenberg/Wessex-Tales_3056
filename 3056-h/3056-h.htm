<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>An apology is perhaps needed for the neglect of contrast which is
shown by presenting two consecutive stories of hangmen in such a small
collection as the following.&nbsp; But in the neighbourhood of county-towns
tales of executions used to form a large proportion of the local traditions;
and though never personally acquainted with any chief operator at such
scenes, the writer of these pages had as a boy the privilege of being
on speaking terms with a man who applied for the office, and who sank
into an incurable melancholy because he failed to get it, some slight
mitigation of his grief being to dwell upon striking episodes in the
lives of those happier ones who had held it with success and renown.&nbsp;
His tale of disappointment used to cause some wonder why his ambition
should have taken such an unfortunate form, but its nobleness was never
questioned.&nbsp; In those days, too, there was still living an old
woman who, for the cure of some eating disease, had been taken in her
youth to have her &lsquo;blood turned&rsquo; by a convict&rsquo;s corpse,
in the manner described in &lsquo;The Withered Arm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since writing this story some years ago I have been reminded by an
aged friend who knew &lsquo;Rhoda Brook&rsquo; that, in relating her
dream, my forgetfulness has weakened the facts our of which the tale
grew.&nbsp; In reality it was while lying down on a hot afternoon that
the incubus oppressed her and she flung it off, with the results upon
the body of the original as described.&nbsp; To my mind the occurrence
of such a vision in the daytime is more impressive than if it had happened
in a midnight dream.&nbsp; Readers are therefore asked to correct the
misrelation, which affords an instance of how our imperfect memories
insensibly formalize the fresh originality of living fact&mdash;from
whose shape they slowly depart, as machine-made castings depart by degrees
from the sharp hand-work of the mould.</p>
<p>Among the many devices for concealing smuggled goods in caves and
pits of the earth, that of planting an apple-tree in a tray or box which
was placed over the mouth of the pit is, I believe, unique, and it is
detailed in one of the tales precisely as described by an old carrier
of &lsquo;tubs&rsquo;&mdash;a man who was afterwards in my father&rsquo;s
employ for over thirty years.&nbsp; I never gathered from his reminiscences
what means were adopted for lifting the tree, which, with its roots,
earth, and receptacle, must have been of considerable weight.&nbsp;
There is no doubt, however, that the thing was done through many years.&nbsp;
My informant often spoke, too, of the horribly suffocating sensation
produced by the pair of spirit-tubs slung upon the chest and back, after
stumbling with the burden of them for several miles inland over a rough
country and in darkness.&nbsp; He said that though years of his youth
and young manhood were spent in this irregular business, his profits
from the same, taken all together, did not average the wages he might
have earned in a steady employment, whilst the fatigues and risks were
excessive.</p>
<p>I may add that the first story in the series turns upon a physical
possibility that may attach to women of imaginative temperament, and
that is well supported by the experiences of medical men and other observers
of such manifestations.</p>

<i>April</i> 1896.</p>
<h2>AN IMAGINATIVE WOMAN</h2>
<p>When William Marchmill had finished his inquiries for lodgings at
a well-known watering-place in Upper Wessex, he returned to the hotel
to find his wife.&nbsp; She, with the children, had rambled along the
shore, and Marchmill followed in the direction indicated by the military-looking
hall-porter</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, how far you&rsquo;ve gone!&nbsp; I am quite out of
breath,&rsquo; Marchmill said, rather impatiently, when he came up with
his wife, who was reading as she walked, the three children being considerably
further ahead with the nurse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marchmill started out of the reverie into which the book had
thrown her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been
such a long time.&nbsp; I was tired of staying in that dreary hotel.&nbsp;
But I am sorry if you have wanted me, Will?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have had trouble to suit myself.&nbsp; When you see
the airy and comfortable rooms heard of, you find they are stuffy and
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Will you come and see if what I&rsquo;ve fixed
on will do?&nbsp; There is not much room, I am afraid; hut I can light
on nothing better.&nbsp; The town is rather full.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pair left the children and nurse to continue their ramble, and
went back together.</p>
<p>In age well-balanced, in personal appearance fairly matched, and
in domestic requirements conformable, in temper this couple differed,
though even here they did not often clash, he being equable, if not
lymphatic, and she decidedly nervous and sanguine.&nbsp; It was to their
tastes and fancies, those smallest, greatest particulars, that no common
denominator could be applied.&nbsp; Marchmill considered his wife&rsquo;s
likes and inclinations somewhat silly; she considered his sordid and
material.&nbsp; The husband&rsquo;s business was that of a gunmaker
in a thriving city northwards, and his soul was in that business always;
the lady was best characterized by that superannuated phrase of elegance
&lsquo;a votary of the muse.&rsquo;&nbsp; An impressionable, palpitating
creature was Ella, shrinking humanely from detailed knowledge of her
husband&rsquo;s trade whenever she reflected that everything he manufactured
had for its purpose the destruction of life.&nbsp; She could only recover
her equanimity by assuring herself that some, at least, of his weapons
were sooner or later used for the extermination of horrid vermin and
animals almost as cruel to their inferiors in species as human beings
were to theirs.</p>
<p>She had never antecedently regarded this occupation of his as any
objection to having him for a husband.&nbsp; Indeed, the necessity of
getting life-leased at all cost, a cardinal virtue which all good mothers
teach, kept her from thinking of it at all till she had closed with
William, had passed the honeymoon, and reached the reflecting stage.&nbsp;
Then, like a person who has stumbled upon some object in the dark, she
wondered what she had got; mentally walked round it, estimated it; whether
it were rare or common; contained gold, silver, or lead; were a clog
or a pedestal, everything to her or nothing.</p>
<p>She came to some vague conclusions, and since then had kept her heart
alive by pitying her proprietor&rsquo;s obtuseness and want of refinement,
pitying herself, and letting off her delicate and ethereal emotions
in imaginative occupations, day-dreams, and night-sighs, which perhaps
would not much have disturbed William if he had known of them.</p>
<p>Her figure was small, elegant, and slight in build, tripping, or
rather bounding, in movement.&nbsp; She was dark-eyed, and had that
marvellously bright and liquid sparkle in each pupil which characterizes
persons of Ella&rsquo;s cast of soul, and is too often a cause of heartache
to the possessor&rsquo;s male friends, ultimately sometimes to herself.&nbsp;
Her husband was a tall, long-featured man, with a brown beard; he had
a pondering regard; and was, it must be added, usually kind and tolerant
to her.&nbsp; He spoke in squarely shaped sentences, and was supremely
satisfied with a condition of sublunary things which made weapons a
necessity.</p>
<p>Husband and wife walked till they had reached the house they were
in search of, which stood in a terrace facing the sea, and was fronted
by a small garden of wind-proof and salt-proof evergreens, stone steps
leading up to the porch.&nbsp; It had its number in the row, but, being
rather larger than the rest, was in addition sedulously distinguished
as Coburg House by its landlady, though everybody else called it &lsquo;Thirteen,
New Parade.&rsquo;&nbsp; The spot was bright and lively now; but in
winter it became necessary to place sandbags against the door, and to
stuff up the keyhole against the wind and rain, which had worn the paint
so thin that the priming and knotting showed through.</p>
<p>The householder, who bad been watching for the gentleman&rsquo;s
return, met them in the passage, and showed the rooms.&nbsp; She informed
them that she was a professional man&rsquo;s widow, left in needy circumstances
by the rather sudden death of her husband, and she spoke anxiously of
the conveniences of the establishment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marchmill said that she liked the situation and the house; but,
it being small, there would not be accommodation enough, unless she
could have all the rooms.</p>
<p>The landlady mused with an air of disappointment.&nbsp; She wanted
the visitors to be her tenants very badly, she said, with obvious honesty.&nbsp;
But unfortunately two of the rooms were occupied permanently by a bachelor
gentleman.&nbsp; He did not pay season prices, it was true; but as he
kept on his apartments all the year round, and was an extremely nice
and interesting young man, who gave no trouble, she did not like to
turn him out for a month&rsquo;s &lsquo;let,&rsquo; even at a high figure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps, however,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;he might offer to
go for a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They would not hear of this, and went back to the hotel, intending
to proceed to the agent&rsquo;s to inquire further.&nbsp; Hardly had
they sat down to tea when the landlady called.&nbsp; Her gentleman,
she said, had been so obliging as to offer to give up his rooms for
three or four weeks rather than drive the new-comers away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very kind, but we won&rsquo;t inconvenience him in that
way,&rsquo; said the Marchmills.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it won&rsquo;t inconvenience him, I assure you!&rsquo;
said the landlady eloquently.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see, he&rsquo;s a different
sort of young man from most&mdash;dreamy, solitary, rather melancholy&mdash;and
he cares more to be here when the south-westerly gales are beating against
the door, and the sea washes over the Parade, and there&rsquo;s not
a soul in the place, than he does now in the season.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
just as soon be where, in fact, he&rsquo;s going temporarily, to a little
cottage on the Island opposite, for a change.&rsquo;&nbsp; She hoped
therefore that they would come.</p>
<p>The Marchmill family accordingly took possession of the house next
day, and it seemed to suit them very well.&nbsp; After luncheon Mr.
Marchmill strolled out towards the pier, and Mrs. Marchmill, having
despatched the children to their outdoor amusements on the sands, settled
herself in more completely, examining this and that article, and testing
the reflecting powers of the mirror in the wardrobe door.</p>
<p>In the small back sitting-room, which had been the young bachelor&rsquo;s,
she found furniture of a more personal nature than in the rest.&nbsp;
Shabby books, of correct rather than rare editions, were piled up in
a queerly reserved manner in corners, as if the previous occupant had
not conceived the possibility that any incoming person of the season&rsquo;s
bringing could care to look inside them.&nbsp; The landlady hovered
on the threshold to rectify anything that Mrs. Marchmill might not find
to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make this my own little room,&rsquo; said the latter,
&lsquo;because the books are here.&nbsp; By the way, the person who
has left seems to have a good many.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t mind my reading
some of them, Mrs. Hooper, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O dear no, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Yes, he has a good many.&nbsp;
You see, he is in the literary line himself somewhat.&nbsp; He is a
poet&mdash;yes, really a poet&mdash;and he has a little income of his
own, which is enough to write verses on, but not enough for cutting
a figure, even if he cared to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A poet!&nbsp; O, I did not know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marchmill opened one of the books, and saw the owner&rsquo;s
name written on the title-page.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; she continued;
&lsquo;I know his name very well&mdash;Robert Trewe&mdash;of course
I do; and his writings!&nbsp; And it is <i>his</i> rooms we have taken,
and <i>him</i> we have turned out of his home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ella Marchmill, sitting down alone a few minutes later, thought with
interested surprise of Robert Trewe.&nbsp; Her own latter history will
best explain that interest.&nbsp; Herself the only daughter of a struggling
man of letters, she had during the last year or two taken to writing
poems, in an endeavour to find a congenial channel in which to let flow
her painfully embayed emotions, whose former limpidity and sparkle seemed
departing in the stagnation caused by the routine of a practical household
and the gloom of bearing children to a commonplace father.&nbsp; These
poems, subscribed with a masculine pseudonym, had appeared in various
obscure magazines, and in two cases in rather prominent ones.&nbsp;
In the second of the latter the page which bore her effusion at the
bottom, in smallish print, bore at the top, in large print, a few verses
on the same subject by this very man, Robert Trewe.&nbsp; Both of them
had, in fact, been struck by a tragic incident reported in the daily
papers, and had used it simultaneously as an inspiration, the editor
remarking in a note upon the coincidence, and that the excellence of
both poems prompted him to give them together.</p>
<p>After that event Ella, otherwise &lsquo;John Ivy,&rsquo; had watched
with much attention the appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing
the signature of Robert Trewe, who, with a man&rsquo;s unsusceptibility
on the question of sex, had never once thought of passing himself off
as a woman.&nbsp; To be sure, Mrs. Marchmill had satisfied herself with
a sort of reason for doing the contrary in her case; that nobody might
believe in her inspiration if they found that the sentiments came from
a pushing tradesman&rsquo;s wife, from the mother of three children
by a matter-of-fact small-arms manufacturer.</p>
<p>Trewe&rsquo;s verse contrasted with that of the rank and file of
recent minor poets in being impassioned rather than ingenious, luxuriant
rather than finished.&nbsp; Neither <i>symboliste</i> nor <i>d&eacute;cadent</i>,
he was a pessimist in so far as that character applies to a man who
looks at the worst contingencies as well as the best in the human condition.&nbsp;
Being little attracted by excellences of form and rhythm apart from
content, he sometimes, when feeling outran his artistic speed, perpetrated
sonnets in the loosely rhymed Elizabethan fashion, which every right-minded
reviewer said he ought not to have done.</p>
<p>With sad and hopeless envy, Ella Marchmill had often and often scanned
the rival poet&rsquo;s work, so much stronger as it always was than
her own feeble lines.&nbsp; She had imitated him, and her inability
to touch his level would send her into fits of despondency.&nbsp; Months
passed away thus, till she observed from the publishers&rsquo; list
that Trewe had collected his fugitive pieces into a volume, which was
duly issued, and was much or little praised according to chance, and
had a sale quite sufficient to pay for the printing.</p>
<p>This step onward had suggested to John Ivy the idea of collecting
her pieces also, or at any rate of making up a book of her rhymes by
adding many in manuscript to the few that had seen the light, for she
had been able to get no great number into print.&nbsp; A ruinous charge
was made for costs of publication; a few reviews noticed her poor little
volume; but nobody talked of it, nobody bought it, and it fell dead
in a fortnight&mdash;if it had ever been alive.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s thoughts were diverted to another groove just
then by the discovery that she was going to have a third child, and
the collapse of her poetical venture had perhaps less effect upon her
mind than it might have done if she had been domestically unoccupied.&nbsp;
Her husband had paid the publisher&rsquo;s bill with the doctor&rsquo;s,
and there it all had ended for the time.&nbsp; But, though less than
a poet of her century, Ella was more than a mere multiplier of her kind,
and latterly she had begun to feel the old afflatus once more.&nbsp;
And now by an odd conjunction she found herself in the rooms of Robert
Trewe.</p>
<p>She thoughtfully rose from her chair and searched the apartment with
the interest of a fellow-tradesman.&nbsp; Yes, the volume of his own
verse was among the rest.&nbsp; Though quite familiar with its contents,
she read it here as if it spoke aloud to her, then called up Mrs. Hooper,
the landlady, for some trivial service, and inquired again about the
young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be interested in him, ma&rsquo;am,
if you could see him, only he&rsquo;s so shy that I don&rsquo;t suppose
you will.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Hooper seemed nothing loth to minister to
her tenant&rsquo;s curiosity about her predecessor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lived
here long?&nbsp; Yes, nearly two years.&nbsp; He keeps on his rooms
even when he&rsquo;s not here: the soft air of this place suits his
chest, and he likes to be able to come back at any time.&nbsp; He is
mostly writing or reading, and doesn&rsquo;t see many people, though,
for the matter of that, he is such a good, kind young fellow that folks
would only be too glad to be friendly with him if they knew him.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t meet kind-hearted people every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s kind-hearted . . . and good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he&rsquo;ll oblige me in anything if I ask him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Trewe,&rdquo; I say to him sometimes, &ldquo;you are rather
out of spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I am, Mrs. Hooper,&rdquo;
he&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t know how you should find
it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not take a little change?&rdquo; I ask.&nbsp;
Then in a day or two he&rsquo;ll say that he will take a trip to Paris,
or Norway, or somewhere; and I assure you he comes back all the better
for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, indeed!&nbsp; His is a sensitive nature, no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Still he&rsquo;s odd in some things.&nbsp; Once
when he had finished a poem of his composition late at night he walked
up and down the room rehearsing it; and the floors being so thin&mdash;jerry-built
houses, you know, though I say it myself&mdash;he kept me awake up above
him till I wished him further . . . But we get on very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was but the beginning of a series of conversations about the
rising poet as the days went on.&nbsp; On one of these occasions Mrs.
Hooper drew Ella&rsquo;s attention to what she had not noticed before:
minute scribblings in pencil on the wall-paper behind the curtains at
the head of the bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! let me look,&rsquo; said Mrs. Marchmill, unable to conceal
a rush of tender curiosity as she bent her pretty face close to the
wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hooper, with the manner of a woman
who knew things, &lsquo;are the very beginnings and first thoughts of
his verses.&nbsp; He has tried to rub most of them out, but you can
read them still.&nbsp; My belief is that he wakes up in the night, you
know, with some rhyme in his head, and jots it down there on the wall
lest he should forget it by the morning.&nbsp; Some of these very lines
you see here I have seen afterwards in print in the magazines.&nbsp;
Some are newer; indeed, I have not seen that one before.&nbsp; It must
have been done only a few days ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes! . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>Ella Marchmill flushed without knowing why, and suddenly wished her
companion would go away, now that the information was imparted.&nbsp;
An indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary
made her anxious to read the inscription alone; and she accordingly
waited till she could do so, with a sense that a great store of emotion
would be enjoyed in the act.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the sea was choppy outside the Island, Ella&rsquo;s
husband found it much pleasanter to go sailing and steaming about without
his wife, who was a bad sailor, than with her.&nbsp; He did not disdain
to go thus alone on board the steamboats of the cheap-trippers, where
there was dancing by moonlight, and where the couples would come suddenly
down with a lurch into each other&rsquo;s arms; for, as he blandly told
her, the company was too mixed for him to take her amid such scenes.&nbsp;
Thus, while this thriving manufacturer got a great deal of change and
sea-air out of his sojourn here, the life, external at least, of Ella
was monotonous enough, and mainly consisted in passing a certain number
of hours each day in bathing and walking up and down a stretch of shore.&nbsp;
But the poetic impulse having again waxed strong, she was possessed
by an inner flame which left her hardly conscious of what was proceeding
around her.</p>
<p>She had read till she knew by heart Trewe&rsquo;s last little volume
of verses, and spent a great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival
some of them, till, in her failure, she burst into tears.&nbsp; The
personal element in the magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient,
unapproachable master of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual
and abstract that she could not understand it.&nbsp; To be sure, she
was surrounded noon and night by his customary environment, which literally
whispered of him to her at every moment; but he was a man she had never
seen, and that all that moved her was the instinct to specialize a waiting
emotion on the first fit thing that came to hand did not, of course,
suggest itself to Ella.</p>
<p>In the natural way of passion under the too practical conditions
which civilization has devised for its fruition, her husband&rsquo;s
love for her had not survived, except in the form of fitful friendship,
any more than, or even so much as, her own for him; and, being a woman
of very living ardours, that required sustenance of some sort, they
were beginning to feed on this chancing material, which was, indeed,
of a quality far better than chance usually offers.</p>
<p>One day the children had been playing hide-and-seek in a closet,
whence, in their excitement, they pulled out some clothing.&nbsp; Mrs.
Hooper explained that it belonged to Mr. Trewe, and hung it up in the
closet again.&nbsp; Possessed of her fantasy, Ella went later in the
afternoon, when nobody was in that part of the house, opened the closet,
unhitched one of the articles, a mackintosh, and put it on, with the
waterproof cap belonging to it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The mantle of Elijah!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would
it might inspire me to rival him, glorious genius that he is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes always grew wet when she thought like that, and she turned
to look at herself in the glass.&nbsp; <i>His</i> heart had beat inside
that coat, and <i>his</i> brain had worked under that hat at levels
of thought she would never reach.&nbsp; The consciousness of her weakness
beside him made her feel quite sick.&nbsp; Before she had got the things
off her the door opened, and her husband entered the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She blushed, and removed them</p>
<p>&lsquo;I found them in the closet here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and
put them on in a freak.&nbsp; What have I else to do?&nbsp; You are
always away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always away?&nbsp; Well . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>That evening she had a further talk with the landlady, who might
herself have nourished a half-tender regard for the poet, so ready was
she to discourse ardently about him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are interested in Mr. Trewe, I know, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
she said; &lsquo;and he has just sent to say that he is going to call
to-morrow afternoon to look up some books of his that he wants, if I&rsquo;ll
be in, and he may select them from your room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could very well meet Mr Trewe then, if you&rsquo;d like
to be in the way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She promised with secret delight, and went to bed musing of him.</p>
<p>Next morning her husband observed: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking
of what you said, Ell: that I have gone about a good deal and left you
without much to amuse you.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; To-day,
as there&rsquo;s not much sea, I&rsquo;ll take you with me on board
the yacht.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the first time in her experience of such an offer Ella was not
glad.&nbsp; But she accepted it for the moment.&nbsp; The time for setting
out drew near, and she went to get ready.&nbsp; She stood reflecting.&nbsp;
The longing to see the poet she was now distinctly in love with overpowered
all other considerations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rsquo; she said to herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to be away!&nbsp; And I won&rsquo;t go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told her husband that she had changed her mind about wishing
to sail.&nbsp; He was indifferent, and went his way.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day the house was quiet, the children having
gone out upon the sands.&nbsp; The blinds waved in the sunshine to the
soft, steady stroke of the sea beyond the wall; and the notes of the
Green Silesian band, a troop of foreign gentlemen hired for the season,
had drawn almost all the residents and promenaders away from the vicinity
of Coburg House.&nbsp; A knock was audible at the door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marchmill did not hear any servant go to answer it, and she
became impatient.&nbsp; The books were in the room where she sat; but
nobody came up.&nbsp; She rang the bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is some person waiting at the door,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone long ago.&nbsp; I
answered it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hooper came in herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So disappointing!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Trewe
not coming after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I heard him knock, I fancy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; that was somebody inquiring for lodgings who came to the
wrong house.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that Mr. Trewe sent a note just
before lunch to say I needn&rsquo;t get any tea for him, as he should
not require the books, and wouldn&rsquo;t come to select them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ella was miserable, and for a long time could not even re-read his
mournful ballad on &lsquo;Severed Lives,&rsquo; so aching was her erratic
little heart, and so tearful her eyes.&nbsp; When the children came
in with wet stockings, and ran up to her to tell her of their adventures,
she could not feel that she cared about them half as much as usual.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Hooper, have you a photograph of&mdash;the gentleman
who lived here?&rsquo;&nbsp; She was getting to be curiously shy in
mentioning his name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in the ornamental frame on the
mantelpiece in your own bedroom, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the Royal Duke and Duchess are in that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so they are; but he&rsquo;s behind them.&nbsp; He belongs
rightly to that frame, which I bought on purpose; but as he went away
he said: &ldquo;Cover me up from those strangers that are coming, for
God&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want them staring at me, and I
am sure they won&rsquo;t want me staring at them.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I
slipped in the Duke and Duchess temporarily in front of him, as they
had no frame, and Royalties are more suitable for letting furnished
than a private young man.&nbsp; If you take &rsquo;em out you&rsquo;ll
see him under.&nbsp; Lord, ma&rsquo;am, he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if he
knew it!&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t think the next tenant would be such an
attractive lady as you, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of hiding
himself; perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he handsome?&rsquo; she asked timidly.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;I</i> call him so.&nbsp; Some, perhaps, wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should I?&rsquo; she asked, with eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you would, though some would say he&rsquo;s more striking
than handsome; a large-eyed thoughtful fellow, you know, with a very
electric flash in his eye when he looks round quickly, such as you&rsquo;d
expect a poet to be who doesn&rsquo;t get his living by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Several years older than yourself, ma&rsquo;am; about thirty-one
or two, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ella was, as a matter of fact, a few months over thirty herself;
but she did not look nearly so much.&nbsp; Though so immature in nature,
she was entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin
to suspect that last love may be stronger than first love; and she would
soon, alas, enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the
vainer ones of her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise
than with their backs to the window or the blinds half down.&nbsp; She
reflected on Mrs. Hooper&rsquo;s remark, and said no more about age.</p>
<p>Just then a telegram was brought up.&nbsp; It came from her husband,
who had gone down the Channel as far as Budmouth with his friends in
the yacht, and would not be able to get back till next day.</p>
<p>After her light dinner Ella idled about the shore with the children
till dusk, thinking of the yet uncovered photograph in her room, with
a serene sense of something ecstatic to come.&nbsp; For, with the subtle
luxuriousness of fancy in which this young woman was an adept, on learning
that her husband was to be absent that night she had refrained from
incontinently rushing upstairs and opening the picture-frame, preferring
to reserve the inspection till she could be alone, and a more romantic
tinge be imparted to the occasion by silence, candles, solemn sea and
stars outside, than was afforded by the garish afternoon sunlight.</p>
<p>The children had been sent to bed, and Ella soon followed, though
it was not yet ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; To gratify her passionate curiosity
she now made her preparations, first getting rid of superfluous garments
and putting on her dressing-gown, then arranging a chair in front of
the table and reading several pages of Trewe&rsquo;s tenderest utterances.&nbsp;
Then she fetched the portrait-frame to the light, opened the back, took
out the likeness, and set it up before her.</p>
<p>It was a striking countenance to look upon.&nbsp; The poet wore a
luxuriant black moustache and imperial, and a slouched hat which shaded
the forehead.&nbsp; The large dark eyes, described by the landlady,
showed an unlimited capacity for misery; they looked out from beneath
well-shaped brows as if they were reading the universe in the microcosm
of the confronter&rsquo;s face, and were not altogether overjoyed at
what the spectacle portended.</p>
<p>Ella murmured in her lowest, richest, tenderest tone: &lsquo;And
it&rsquo;s <i>you</i> who&rsquo;ve so cruelly eclipsed me these many
times!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she gazed long at the portrait she fell into thought, till her
eyes filled with tears, and she touched the cardboard with her lips.&nbsp;
Then she laughed with a nervous lightness, and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>She thought how wicked she was, a woman having a husband and three
children, to let her mind stray to a stranger in this unconscionable
manner.&nbsp; No, he was not a stranger!&nbsp; She knew his thoughts
and feelings as well as she knew her own; they were, in fact, the self-same
thoughts and feelings as hers, which her husband distinctly lacked;
perhaps luckily for himself; considering that he had to provide for
family expenses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s nearer my real self, he&rsquo;s more intimate with
the real me than Will is, after all, even though I&rsquo;ve never seen
him,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She laid his book and picture on the table at the bedside, and when
she was reclining on the pillow she re-read those of Robert Trewe&rsquo;s
verses which she had marked from time to time as most touching and true.&nbsp;
Putting these aside, she set up the photograph on its edge upon the
coverlet, and contemplated it as she lay.&nbsp; Then she scanned again
by the light of the candle the half-obliterated pencillings on the wall-paper
beside her head.&nbsp; There they were&mdash;phrases, couplets, <i>bouts-rim&eacute;s</i>,
beginnings and middles of lines, ideas in the rough, like Shelley&rsquo;s
scraps, and the least of them so intense, so sweet, so palpitating,
that it seemed as if his very breath, warm and loving, fanned her cheeks
from those walls, walls that had surrounded his head times and times
as they surrounded her own now.&nbsp; He must often have put up his
hand so&mdash;with the pencil in it.&nbsp; Yes, the writing was sideways,
as it would be if executed by one who extended his arm thus.</p>
<p>These inscribed shapes of the poet&rsquo;s world,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Forms more real than living man,<br />
Nurslings of immortality,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were, no doubt, the thoughts and spirit-strivings which had come
to him in the dead of night, when he could let himself go and have no
fear of the frost of criticism.&nbsp; No doubt they had often been written
up hastily by the light of the moon, the rays of the lamp, in the blue-grey
dawn, in full daylight perhaps never.&nbsp; And now her hair was dragging
where his arm had lain when he secured the fugitive fancies; she was
sleeping on a poet&rsquo;s lips, immersed in the very essence of him,
permeated by his spirit as by an ether.</p>
<p>While she was dreaming the minutes away thus, a footstep came upon
the stairs, and in a moment she heard her husband&rsquo;s heavy step
on the landing immediately without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ell, where are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>What possessed her she could not have described, but, with an instinctive
objection to let her husband know what she had been doing, she slipped
the photograph under the pillow just as he flung open the door, with
the air of a man who had dined not badly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I beg pardon,&rsquo; said William Marchmill.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have
you a headache?&nbsp; I am afraid I have disturbed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not got a headache,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How is it you&rsquo;ve come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we found we could get back in very good time after all,
and I didn&rsquo;t want to make another day of it, because of going
somewhere else to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I come down again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as tired as a dog.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
had a good feed, and I shall turn in straight off.&nbsp; I want to get
out at six o&rsquo;clock to-morrow if I can . . . I shan&rsquo;t disturb
you by my getting up; it will be long before you are awake.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he came forward into the room.</p>
<p>While her eyes followed his movements, Ella softly pushed the photograph
further out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure you&rsquo;re not ill?&rsquo; he asked, bending over her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, only wicked!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p>Next morning Marchmill was called at six o&rsquo;clock; and in waking
and yawning she heard him muttering to himself: &lsquo;What the deuce
is this that&rsquo;s been crackling under me so?&rsquo;&nbsp; Imagining
her asleep he searched round him and withdrew something.&nbsp; Through
her half-opened eyes she perceived it to be Mr. Trewe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&rsquo; her husband exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, dear?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you are awake?&nbsp; Ha! ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some bloke&rsquo;s photograph&mdash;a friend of our landlady&rsquo;s,
I suppose.&nbsp; I wonder how it came here; whisked off the table by
accident perhaps when they were making the bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was looking at it yesterday, and it must have dropped in
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he&rsquo;s a friend of yours?&nbsp; Bless his picturesque
heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ella&rsquo;s loyalty to the object of her admiration could not endure
to hear him ridiculed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a clever man!&rsquo;
she said, with a tremor in her gentle voice which she herself felt to
be absurdly uncalled for.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a rising poet&mdash;the gentleman who occupied two of
these rooms before we came, though I&rsquo;ve never seen him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know, if you&rsquo;ve never seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Hooper told me when she showed me the photograph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O; well, I must up and be off.&nbsp; I shall be home rather
early.&nbsp; Sorry I can&rsquo;t take you to-day, dear.&nbsp; Mind the
children don&rsquo;t go getting drowned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That day Mrs. Marchmill inquired if Mr. Trewe were likely to call
at any other time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hooper.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming
this day week to stay with a friend near here till you leave.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be sure to call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marchmill did return quite early in the afternoon; and, opening some
letters which had arrived in his absence, declared suddenly that he
and his family would have to leave a week earlier than they had expected
to do&mdash;in short, in three days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely we can stay a week longer?&rsquo; she pleaded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I like it here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It is getting rather slow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you might leave me and the children!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How perverse you are, Ell!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp;
And have to come to fetch you!&nbsp; No: we&rsquo;ll all return together;
and we&rsquo;ll make out our time in North Wales or Brighton a little
later on.&nbsp; Besides, you&rsquo;ve three days longer yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to be her doom not to meet the man for whose rival talent
she had a despairing admiration, and to whose person she was now absolutely
attached.&nbsp; Yet she determined to make a last effort; and having
gathered from her landlady that Trewe was living in a lonely spot not
far from the fashionable town on the Island opposite, she crossed over
in the packet from the neighbouring pier the following afternoon.</p>
<p>What a useless journey it was!&nbsp; Ella knew but vaguely where
the house stood, and when she fancied she had found it, and ventured
to inquire of a pedestrian if he lived there, the answer returned by
the man was that he did not know.&nbsp; And if he did live there, how
could she call upon him?&nbsp; Some women might have the assurance to
do it, but she had not.&nbsp; How crazy he would think her.&nbsp; She
might have asked him to call upon her, perhaps; but she had not the
courage for that, either.&nbsp; She lingered mournfully about the picturesque
seaside eminence till it was time to return to the town and enter the
steamer for recrossing, reaching home for dinner without having been
greatly missed.</p>
<p>At the last moment, unexpectedly enough, her husband said that he
should have no objection to letting her and the children stay on till
the end of the week, since she wished to do so, if she felt herself
able to get home without him.&nbsp; She concealed the pleasure this
extension of time gave her; and Marchmill went off the next morning
alone.</p>
<p>But the week passed, and Trewe did not call.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning the remaining members of the Marchmill family
departed from the place which had been productive of so much fervour
in her.&nbsp; The dreary, dreary train; the sun shining in moted beams
upon the hot cushions; the dusty permanent way; the mean rows of wire&mdash;these
things were her accompaniment: while out of the window the deep blue
sea-levels disappeared from her gaze, and with them her poet&rsquo;s
home.&nbsp; Heavy-hearted, she tried to read, and wept instead.</p>
<p>Mr. Marchmill was in a thriving way of business, and he and his family
lived in a large new house, which stood in rather extensive grounds
a few miles outside the city wherein he carried on his trade.&nbsp;
Ella&rsquo;s life was lonely here, as the suburban life is apt to be,
particularly at certain seasons; and she had ample time to indulge her
taste for lyric and elegiac composition.&nbsp; She had hardly got back
when she encountered a piece by Robert Trewe in the new number of her
favourite magazine, which must have been written almost immediately
before her visit to Solentsea, for it contained the very couplet she
had seen pencilled on the wallpaper by the bed, and Mrs. Hooper had
declared to be recent.&nbsp; Ella could resist no longer, but seizing
a pen impulsively, wrote to him as a brother-poet, using the name of
John Ivy, congratulating him in her letter on his triumphant executions
in metre and rhythm of thoughts that moved his soul, as compared with
her own brow-beaten efforts in the same pathetic trade.</p>
<p>To this address there came a response in a few days, little as she
had dared to hope for it&mdash;a civil and brief note, in which the
young poet stated that, though he was not well acquainted with Mr. Ivy&rsquo;s
verse, he recalled the name as being one he had seen attached to some
very promising pieces; that he was glad to gain Mr. Ivy&rsquo;s acquaintance
by letter, and should certainly look with much interest for his productions
in the future.</p>
<p>There must have been something juvenile or timid in her own epistle,
as one ostensibly coming from a man, she declared to herself; for Trewe
quite adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply.&nbsp;
But what did it matter? he had replied; he had written to her with his
own hand from that very room she knew so well, for he was now back again
in his quarters.</p>
<p>The correspondence thus begun was continued for two months or more,
Ella Marchmill sending him from time to time some that she considered
to be the best of her pieces, which he very kindly accepted, though
he did not say he sedulously read them, nor did he send her any of his
own in return.&nbsp; Ella would have been more hurt at this than she
was if she had not known that Trewe laboured under the impression that
she was one of his own sex.</p>
<p>Yet the situation was unsatisfactory.&nbsp; A flattering little voice
told her that, were he only to see her, matters would be otherwise.&nbsp;
No doubt she would have helped on this by making a frank confession
of womanhood, to begin with, if something had not happened, to her delight,
to render it unnecessary.&nbsp; A friend of her husband&rsquo;s, the
editor of the most important newspaper in the city and county, who was
dining with them one day, observed during their conversation about the
poet that his (the editor&rsquo;s) brother the landscape-painter was
a friend of Mr. Trewe&rsquo;s, and that the two men were at that very
moment in Wales together.</p>
<p>Ella was slightly acquainted with the editor&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp;
The next morning down she sat and wrote, inviting him to stay at her
house for a short time on his way back, and requesting him to bring
with him, if practicable, his companion Mr. Trewe, whose acquaintance
she was anxious to make.&nbsp; The answer arrived after some few days.&nbsp;
Her correspondent and his friend Trewe would have much satisfaction
in accepting her invitation on their way southward, which would be on
such and such a day in the following week.</p>
<p>Ella was blithe and buoyant.&nbsp; Her scheme had succeeded; her
beloved though as yet unseen one was coming.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, he
standeth behind our wall; he looked forth at the windows, showing himself
through the lattice,&rdquo; she thought ecstatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,
lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear
on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice
of the turtle is heard in our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was necessary to consider the details of lodging and feeding
him.&nbsp; This she did most solicitously, and awaited the pregnant
day and hour.</p>
<p>It was about five in the afternoon when she heard a ring at the door
and the editor&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s voice in the hall.&nbsp; Poetess
as she was, or as she thought herself, she had not been too sublime
that day to dress with infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich
material, having a faint resemblance to the <i>chiton</i> of the Greeks,
a style just then in vogue among ladies of an artistic and romantic
turn, which had been obtained by Ella of her Bond Street dressmaker
when she was last in London.&nbsp; Her visitor entered the drawing-room.&nbsp;
She looked towards his rear; nobody else came through the door.&nbsp;
Where, in the name of the God of Love, was Robert Trewe?</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said the painter, after their introductory
words had been spoken.&nbsp; &lsquo;Trewe is a curious fellow, you know,
Mrs. Marchmill.&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d come; then he said he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s rather dusty.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been doing a few miles with
knapsacks, you know; and he wanted to get on home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s not coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not; and he asked me to make his apologies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you p-p-part from him?&rsquo; she asked, her nether
lip starting off quivering so much that it was like a <i>tremolo</i>-stop
opened in her speech.&nbsp; She longed to run away from this dreadful
bore and cry her eyes out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just now, in the turnpike road yonder there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! he has actually gone past my gates?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; When we got to them&mdash;handsome gates they are,
too, the finest bit of modern wrought-iron work I have seen&mdash;when
we came to them we stopped, talking there a little while, and then he
wished me good-bye and went on.&nbsp; The truth is, he&rsquo;s a little
bit depressed just now, and doesn&rsquo;t want to see anybody.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a very good fellow, and a warm friend, but a little uncertain
and gloomy sometimes; he thinks too much of things.&nbsp; His poetry
is rather too erotic and passionate, you know, for some tastes; and
he has just come in for a terrible slating from the --- <i>Review</i>
that was published yesterday; he saw a copy of it at the station by
accident.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;ve read it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the better.&nbsp; O, it is not worth thinking of;
just one of those articles written to order, to please the narrow-minded
set of subscribers upon whom the circulation depends.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s
upset by it.&nbsp; He says it is the misrepresentation that hurts him
so; that, though he can stand a fair attack, he can&rsquo;t stand lies
that he&rsquo;s powerless to refute and stop from spreading.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
just Trewe&rsquo;s weak point.&nbsp; He lives so much by himself that
these things affect him much more than they would if he were in the
bustle of fashionable or commercial life.&nbsp; So he wouldn&rsquo;t
come here, making the excuse that it all looked so new and monied&mdash;if
you&rsquo;ll pardon&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;he must have known&mdash;there was sympathy here!&nbsp;
Has he never said anything about getting letters from this address?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, he has, from John Ivy&mdash;perhaps a relative of
yours, he thought, visiting here at the time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he&mdash;like Ivy, did he say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that he took any great interest in
Ivy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or in his poems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or in his poems&mdash;so far as I know, that is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert Trewe took no interest in her house, in her poems, or in their
writer.&nbsp; As soon as she could get away she went into the nursery
and tried to let off her emotion by unnecessarily kissing the children,
till she had a sudden sense of disgust at being reminded how plain-looking
they were, like their father.</p>
<p>The obtuse and single-minded landscape-painter never once perceived
from her conversation that it was only Trewe she wanted, and not himself.&nbsp;
He made the best of his visit, seeming to enjoy the society of Ella&rsquo;s
husband, who also took a great fancy to him, and showed him everywhere
about the neighbourhood, neither of them noticing Ella&rsquo;s mood.</p>
<p>The painter had been gone only a day or two when, while sitting upstairs
alone one morning, she glanced over the London paper just arrived, and
read the following paragraph:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;SUICIDE OF A POET</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Robert Trewe, who has been favourably known for some years
as one of our rising lyrists, committed suicide at his lodgings at Solentsea
on Saturday evening last by shooting himself in the right temple with
a revolver.&nbsp; Readers hardly need to be reminded that Mr. Trewe
has recently attracted the attention of a much wider public than had
hitherto known him, by his new volume of verse, mostly of an impassioned
kind, entitled &ldquo;Lyrics to a Woman Unknown,&rdquo; which has been
already favourably noticed in these pages for the extraordinary gamut
of feeling it traverses, and which has been made the subject of a severe,
if not ferocious, criticism in the --- Review.&nbsp; It is supposed,
though not certainly known, that the article may have partially conduced
to the sad act, as a copy of the review in question was found on his
writing-table; and he has been observed to be in a somewhat depressed
state of mind since the critique appeared.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came the report of the inquest, at which the following letter
was read, it having been addressed to a friend at a distance:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR -,&mdash;Before these lines reach your hands
I shall be delivered from the inconveniences of seeing, hearing, and
knowing more of the things around me.&nbsp; I will not trouble you by
giving my reasons for the step I have taken, though I can assure you
they were sound and logical.&nbsp; Perhaps had I been blessed with a
mother, or a sister, or a female friend of another sort tenderly devoted
to me, I might have thought it worth while to continue my present existence.&nbsp;
I have long dreamt of such an unattainable creature, as you know, and
she, this undiscoverable, elusive one, inspired my last volume; the
imaginary woman alone, for, in spite of what has been said in some quarters,
there is no real woman behind the title.&nbsp; She has continued to
the last unrevealed, unmet, unwon.&nbsp; I think it desirable to mention
this in order that no blame may attach to any real woman as having been
the cause of my decease by cruel or cavalier treatment of me.&nbsp;
Tell my landlady that I am sorry to have caused her this unpleasantness;
but my occupancy of the rooms will soon be forgotten.&nbsp; There are
ample funds in my name at the bank to pay all expenses.&nbsp; R. TREWE.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ella sat for a while as if stunned, then rushed into the adjoining
chamber and flung herself upon her face on the bed.</p>
<p>Her grief and distraction shook her to pieces; and she lay in this
frenzy of sorrow for more than an hour.&nbsp; Broken words came every
now and then from her quivering lips: &lsquo;O, if he had only known
of me&mdash;known of me&mdash;me! . . . O, if I had only once met him&mdash;only
once; and put my hand upon his hot forehead&mdash;kissed him&mdash;let
him know how I loved him&mdash;that I would have suffered shame and
scorn, would have lived and died, for him!&nbsp; Perhaps it would have
saved his dear life! . . . But no&mdash;it was not allowed!&nbsp; God
is a jealous God; and that happiness was not for him and me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All possibilities were over; the meeting was stultified.&nbsp; Yet
it was almost visible to her in her fantasy even now, though it could
never be substantiated -</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The hour which might have been, yet might not
be,<br />
Which man&rsquo;s and woman&rsquo;s heart conceived and bore,<br />
Yet whereof life was barren.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>She wrote to the landlady at Solentsea in the third person, in as
subdued a style as she could command, enclosing a postal order for a
sovereign, and informing Mrs. Hooper that Mrs. Marchmill had seen in
the papers the sad account of the poet&rsquo;s death, and having been,
as Mrs. Hooper was aware, much interested in Mr. Trewe during her stay
at Coburg House, she would be obliged if Mrs. Hooper could obtain a
small portion of his hair before his coffin was closed down, and send
it her as a memorial of him, as also the photograph that was in the
frame.</p>
<p>By the return-post a letter arrived containing what had been requested.&nbsp;
Ella wept over the portrait and secured it in her private drawer; the
lock of hair she tied with white ribbon and put in her bosom, whence
she drew it and kissed it every now and then in some unobserved nook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said her husband, looking
up from his newspaper on one of these occasions.&nbsp; &lsquo;Crying
over something?&nbsp; A lock of hair?&nbsp; Whose is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you, Will, just now, unless you
insist!&rsquo; she said, a sob hanging heavy in her voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mind my refusing?&nbsp; I will tell you some day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked away whistling a few bars of no tune in particular; and
when he had got down to his factory in the city the subject came into
Marchmill&rsquo;s head again.</p>
<p>He, too, was aware that a suicide had taken place recently at the
house they had occupied at Solentsea.&nbsp; Having seen the volume of
poems in his wife&rsquo;s hand of late, and heard fragments of the landlady&rsquo;s
conversation about Trewe when they were her tenants, he all at once
said to himself; &lsquo;Why of course it&rsquo;s he!&nbsp; How the devil
did she get to know him?&nbsp; What sly animals women are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he placidly dismissed the matter, and went on with his daily
affairs.&nbsp; By this time Ella at home had come to a determination.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hooper, in sending the hair and photograph, had informed her of
the day of the funeral; and as the morning and noon wore on an overpowering
wish to know where they were laying him took possession of the sympathetic
woman.&nbsp; Caring very little now what her husband or any one else
might think of her eccentricities; she wrote Marchmill a brief note,
stating that she was called away for the afternoon and evening, but
would return on the following morning.&nbsp; This she left on his desk,
and having given the same information to the servants, went out of the
house on foot.</p>
<p>When Mr. Marchmill reached home early in the afternoon the servants
looked anxious.&nbsp; The nurse took him privately aside, and hinted
that her mistress&rsquo;s sadness during the past few days had been
such that she feared she had gone out to drown herself.&nbsp; Marchmill
reflected.&nbsp; Upon the whole he thought that she had not done that.&nbsp;
Without saying whither he was bound he also started off, telling them
not to sit up for him.&nbsp; He drove to the railway-station, and took
a ticket for Solentsea.</p>
<p>It was dark when he reached the place, though he had come by a fast
train, and he knew that if his wife had preceded him thither it could
only have been by a slower train, arriving not a great while before
his own.&nbsp; The season at Solentsea was now past: the parade was
gloomy, and the flys were few and cheap.&nbsp; He asked the way to the
Cemetery, and soon reached it.&nbsp; The gate was locked, but the keeper
let him in, declaring, however, that there was nobody within the precincts.&nbsp;
Although it was not late, the autumnal darkness had now become intense;
and he found some difficulty in keeping to the serpentine path which
led to the quarter where, as the man had told him, the one or two interments
for the day had taken place.&nbsp; He stepped upon the grass, and, stumbling
over some pegs, stooped now and then to discern if possible a figure
against the sky.</p>
<p>He could see none; but lighting on a spot where the soil was trodden,
beheld a crouching object beside a newly made grave.&nbsp; She heard
him, and sprang up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ell, how silly this is!&rsquo; he said indignantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Running away from home&mdash;I never heard such a thing!&nbsp;
Of course I am not jealous of this unfortunate man; but it is too ridiculous
that you, a married woman with three children and a fourth coming, should
go losing your head like this over a dead lover! . . . Do you know you
were locked in?&nbsp; You might not have been able to get out all night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it didn&rsquo;t go far between you and him, for your
own sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t insult me, Will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind, I won&rsquo;t have any more of this sort of thing; do
you hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>He drew her arm within his own, and conducted her out of the Cemetery.&nbsp;
It was impossible to get back that night; and not wishing to be recognized
in their present sorry condition, he took her to a miserable little
coffee-house close to the station, whence they departed early in the
morning, travelling almost without speaking, under the sense that it
was one of those dreary situations occurring in married life which words
could not mend, and reaching their own door at noon.</p>
<p>The months passed, and neither of the twain ever ventured to start
a conversation upon this episode.&nbsp; Ella seemed to be only too frequently
in a sad and listless mood, which might almost have been called pining.&nbsp;
The time was approaching when she would have to undergo the stress of
childbirth for a fourth time, and that apparently did not tend to raise
her spirits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall get over it this time!&rsquo;
she said one day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pooh! what childish foreboding!&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t
it be as well now as ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel almost sure I am going to
die; and I should be glad, if it were not for Nelly, and Frank, and
Tiny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll soon find somebody to fill my place,&rsquo; she
murmured, with a sad smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll have a perfect
right to; I assure you of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ell, you are not thinking still about that&mdash;poetical
friend of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She neither admitted nor denied the charge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not
going to get over my illness this time,&rsquo; she reiterated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Something tells me I shan&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This view of things was rather a bad beginning, as it usually is;
and, in fact, six weeks later, in the month of May, she was lying in
her room, pulseless and bloodless, with hardly strength enough left
to follow up one feeble breath with another, the infant for whose unnecessary
life she was slowly parting with her own being fat and well.&nbsp; Just
before her death she spoke to Marchmill softly:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will, I want to confess to you the entire circumstances of
that&mdash;about you know what&mdash;that time we visited Solentsea.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t tell what possessed me&mdash;how I could forget you so,
my husband!&nbsp; But I had got into a morbid state: I thought you had
been unkind; that you had neglected me; that you weren&rsquo;t up to
my intellectual level, while he was, and far above it.&nbsp; I wanted
a fuller appreciator, perhaps, rather than another lover&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could get no further then for very exhaustion; and she went off
in sudden collapse a few hours later, without having said anything more
to her husband on the subject of her love for the poet.&nbsp; William
Marchmill, in truth, like most husbands of several years&rsquo; standing,
was little disturbed by retrospective jealousies, and had not shown
the least anxiety to press her for confessions concerning a man dead
and gone beyond any power of inconveniencing him more.</p>
<p>But when she had been buried a couple of years it chanced one day
that, in turning over some forgotten papers that he wished to destroy
before his second wife entered the house, he lighted on a lock of hair
in an envelope, with the photograph of the deceased poet, a date being
written on the back in his late wife&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; It was that
of the time they spent at Solentsea.</p>
<p>Marchmill looked long and musingly at the hair and portrait, for
something struck him.&nbsp; Fetching the little boy who had been the
death of his mother, now a noisy toddler, he took him on his knee, held
the lock of hair against the child&rsquo;s head, and set up the photograph
on the table behind, so that he could closely compare the features each
countenance presented.&nbsp; There were undoubtedly strong traces of
resemblance; the dreamy and peculiar expression of the poet&rsquo;s
face sat, as the transmitted idea, upon the child&rsquo;s, and the hair
was of the same hue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I didn&rsquo;t think so!&rsquo; murmured
Marchmill.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then she <i>did</i> play me false with that
fellow at the lodgings!&nbsp; Let me see: the dates&mdash;the second
week in August . . . the third week in May . . . Yes . . . yes . . .
Get away, you poor little brat!&nbsp; You are nothing to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>1893.</p>
<h2>THE THREE STRANGERS</h2>
<p>Among the few features of agricultural England which retain an appearance
but little modified by the lapse of centuries, may be reckoned the high,
grassy and furzy downs, coombs, or ewe-leases, as they are indifferently
called, that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and
south-west.&nbsp; If any mark of human occupation is met with hereon,
it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down, and may
possibly be standing there now.&nbsp; In spite of its loneliness, however,
the spot, by actual measurement, was not more than five miles from a
county-town.&nbsp; Yet that affected it little.&nbsp; Five miles of
irregular upland, during the long inimical seasons, with their sleets,
snows, rains, and mists, afford withdrawing space enough to isolate
a Timon or a Nebuchadnezzar; much less, in fair weather, to please that
less repellent tribe, the poets, philosophers, artists, and others who
&lsquo;conceive and meditate of pleasant things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some old earthen camp or barrow, some clump of trees, at least some
starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the
erection of these forlorn dwellings.&nbsp; But, in the present case,
such a kind of shelter had been disregarded.&nbsp; Higher Crowstairs,
as the house was called, stood quite detached and undefended.&nbsp;
The only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing
of two footpaths at right angles hard by, which may have crossed there
and thus for a good five hundred years.&nbsp; Hence the house was exposed
to the elements on all sides.&nbsp; But, though the wind up here blew
unmistakably when it did blow, and the rain hit hard whenever it fell,
the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable
on the coomb as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground.&nbsp;
The raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows, and the frosts
were scarcely so severe.&nbsp; When the shepherd and his family who
tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure,
they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by &lsquo;wuzzes
and flames&rsquo; (hoarses and phlegms) than when they had lived by
the stream of a snug neighbouring valley.</p>
<p>The night of March 28, 182-, was precisely one of the nights that
were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration.&nbsp; The
level rainstorm smote walls, slopes, and hedges like the clothyard shafts
of Senlac and Crecy.&nbsp; Such sheep and outdoor animals as had no
shelter stood with their buttocks to the winds; while the tails of little
birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown inside-out like
umbrellas.&nbsp; The gable-end of the cottage was stained with wet,
and the eavesdroppings flapped against the wall.&nbsp; Yet never was
commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced.&nbsp; For that cheerful
rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening
of his second girl.</p>
<p>The guests had arrived before the rain began to fall, and they were
all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling.&nbsp;
A glance into the apartment at eight o&rsquo;clock on this eventful
evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable
a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather.&nbsp; The calling
of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highly-polished sheep-crooks
without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace, the curl
of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the
patriarchal pictures of old family Bibles to the most approved fashion
of the last local sheep-fair.&nbsp; The room was lighted by half-a-dozen
candles, having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped
them, in candlesticks that were never used but at high-days, holy-days,
and family feasts.&nbsp; The lights were scattered about the room, two
of them standing on the chimney-piece.&nbsp; This position of candles
was in itself significant.&nbsp; Candles on the chimney-piece always
meant a party.</p>
<p>On the hearth, in front of a back-brand to give substance, blazed
a fire of thorns, that crackled &lsquo;like the laughter of the fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nineteen persons were gathered here.&nbsp; Of these, five women,
wearing gowns of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall;
girls shy and not shy filled the window-bench; four men, including Charley
Jake the hedge-carpenter, Elijah New the parish-clerk, and John Pitcher,
a neighbouring dairyman, the shepherd&rsquo;s father-in-law, lolled
in the settle; a young man and maid, who were blushing over tentative
<i>pourparlers</i> on a life-companionship, sat beneath the corner-cupboard;
and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about
from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was.&nbsp;
Enjoyment was pretty general, and so much the more prevailed in being
unhampered by conventional restrictions.&nbsp; Absolute confidence in
each other&rsquo;s good opinion begat perfect ease, while the finishing
stroke of manner, amounting to a truly princely serenity, was lent to
the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that
they wished to get on in the world, enlarge their minds, or do any eclipsing
thing whatever&mdash;which nowadays so generally nips the bloom and
<i>bonhomie</i> of all except the two extremes of the social scale.</p>
<p>Shepherd Fennel had married well, his wife being a dairyman&rsquo;s
daughter from a vale at a distance, who brought fifty guineas in her
pocket&mdash;and kept them there, till they should be required for ministering
to the needs of a coming family.&nbsp; This frugal woman had been somewhat
exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering.&nbsp;
A sit-still party had its advantages; but an undisturbed position of
ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable
deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry.&nbsp;
A dancing-party was the alternative; but this, while avoiding the foregoing
objection on the score of good drink, had a counterbalancing disadvantage
in the matter of good victuals, the ravenous appetites engendered by
the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery.&nbsp; Shepherdess
Fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances
with short periods of talk and singing, so as to hinder any ungovernable
rage in either.&nbsp; But this scheme was entirely confined to her own
gentle mind: the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most
reckless phases of hospitality.</p>
<p>The fiddler was a boy of those parts, about twelve years of age,
who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels, though his fingers
were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the
high notes, from which he scrambled back to the first position with
sounds not of unmixed purity of tone.&nbsp; At seven the shrill tweedle-dee
of this youngster had begun, accompanied by a booming ground-bass from
Elijah New, the parish-clerk, who had thoughtfully brought with him
his favourite musical instrument, the serpent.&nbsp; Dancing was instantaneous,
Mrs. Fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the
dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>But Elijah and the boy, in the excitement of their position, quite
forgot the injunction.&nbsp; Moreover, Oliver Giles, a man of seventeen,
one of the dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of
thirty-three rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece
to the musicians, as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle
and wind.&nbsp; Mrs. Fennel, seeing the steam begin to generate on the
countenances of her guests, crossed over and touched the fiddler&rsquo;s
elbow and put her hand on the serpent&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; But they
took no notice, and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess
if she were to interfere too markedly, she retired and sat down helpless.&nbsp;
And so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury, the performers moving
in their planet-like courses, direct and retrograde, from apogee to
perigee, till the hand of the well-kicked clock at the bottom of the
room had travelled over the circumference of an hour.</p>
<p>While these cheerful events were in course of enactment within Fennel&rsquo;s
pastoral dwelling, an incident having considerable bearing on the party
had occurred in the gloomy night without.&nbsp; Mrs. Fennel&rsquo;s
concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point
of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher
Crowstairs from the direction of the distant town.&nbsp; This personage
strode on through the rain without a pause, following the little-worn
path which, further on in its course, skirted the shepherd&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>It was nearly the time of full moon, and on this account, though
the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud, ordinary objects
out of doors were readily visible.&nbsp; The sad wan light revealed
the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame; his gait suggested
that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility,
though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion
required.&nbsp; At a rough guess, he might have been about forty years
of age.&nbsp; He appeared tall, but a recruiting sergeant, or other
person accustomed to the judging of men&rsquo;s heights by the eye,
would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness, and
that he was not more than five-feet-eight or nine.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the regularity of his tread, there was caution in
it, as in that of one who mentally feels his way; and despite the fact
that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he
wore, there was something about him which suggested that he naturally
belonged to the black-coated tribes of men.&nbsp; His clothes were of
fustian, and his boots hobnailed, yet in his progress he showed not
the mud-accustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry.</p>
<p>By the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd&rsquo;s premises
the rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence.&nbsp;
The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of
wind and rain, and this induced him to stand still.&nbsp; The most salient
of the shepherd&rsquo;s domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward
corner of his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle
of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional
frontage was unknown.&nbsp; The traveller&rsquo;s eye was attracted
to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered
it.&nbsp; He turned aside, and, finding it empty, stood under the pent-roof
for shelter.</p>
<p>While he stood, the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house,
and the lesser strains of the fiddler, reached the spot as an accompaniment
to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod, its louder beating
on the cabbage-leaves of the garden, on the eight or ten beehives just
discernible by the path, and its dripping from the eaves into a row
of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage.&nbsp;
For at Higher Crowstairs, as at all such elevated domiciles, the grand
difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water; and a casual
rainfall was utilized by turning out, as catchers, every utensil that
the house contained.&nbsp; Some queer stories might be told of the contrivances
for economy in suds and dish-waters that are absolutely necessitated
in upland habitations during the droughts of summer.&nbsp; But at this
season there were no such exigencies; a mere acceptance of what the
skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store.</p>
<p>At last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent.&nbsp;
This cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the
reverie into which he had lapsed, and, emerging from the shed, with
an apparently new intention, he walked up the path to the house-door.&nbsp;
Arrived here, his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside
the row of vessels, and to drink a copious draught from one of them.&nbsp;
Having quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock, but
paused with his eye upon the panel.&nbsp; Since the dark surface of
the wood revealed absolutely nothing, it was evident that he must be
mentally looking through the door, as if he wished to measure thereby
all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include, and how
they might bear upon the question of his entry.</p>
<p>In his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around.&nbsp;
Not a soul was anywhere visible.&nbsp; The garden-path stretched downward
from his feet, gleaming like the track of a snail; the roof of the little
well (mostly dry), the well-cover, the top rail of the garden-gate,
were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze; while, far away in the
vale, a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers
were high in the meads.&nbsp; Beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights
through the beating drops&mdash;lights that denoted the situation of
the county-town from which he had appeared to come.&nbsp; The absence
of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions,
and he knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Within, a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical
sound.&nbsp; The hedge-carpenter was suggesting a song to the company,
which nobody just then was inclined to undertake, so that the knock
afforded a not unwelcome diversion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Walk in!&rsquo; said the shepherd promptly.</p>
<p>The latch clicked upward, and out of the night our pedestrian appeared
upon the door-mat.&nbsp; The shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest
candles, and turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and
not unprepossessing as to feature.&nbsp; His hat, which for a moment
he did not remove, hung low over his eyes, without concealing that they
were large, open, and determined, moving with a flash rather than a
glance round the room.&nbsp; He seemed pleased with his survey, and,
baring his shaggy head, said, in a rich deep voice, &lsquo;The rain
is so heavy, friends, that I ask leave to come in and rest awhile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure, stranger,&rsquo; said the shepherd.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
faith, you&rsquo;ve been lucky in choosing your time, for we are having
a bit of a fling for a glad cause&mdash;though, to be sure, a man could
hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor less,&rsquo; spoke up a woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;For &rsquo;tis
best to get your family over and done with, as soon as you can, so as
to be all the earlier out of the fag o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what may be this glad cause?&rsquo; asked the stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A birth and christening,&rsquo; said the shepherd.</p>
<p>The stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too
many or too few of such episodes, and being invited by a gesture to
a pull at the mug, he readily acquiesced.&nbsp; His manner, which, before
entering, had been so dubious, was now altogether that of a careless
and candid man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Late to be traipsing athwart this coomb&mdash;hey?&rsquo;
said the engaged man of fifty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Late it is, master, as you say.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take a seat
in the chimney-corner, if you have nothing to urge against it, ma&rsquo;am;
for I am a little moist on the side that was next the rain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Shepherd Fennel assented, and made room for the self-invited
comer, who, having got completely inside the chimney-corner, stretched
out his legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at
home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am rather cracked in the vamp,&rsquo; he said freely,
seeing that the eyes of the shepherd&rsquo;s wife fell upon his boots,
&lsquo;and I am not well fitted either.&nbsp; I have had some rough
times lately, and have been forced to pick up what I can get in the
way of wearing, but I must find a suit better fit for working-days when
I reach home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of hereabouts?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite that&mdash;further up the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so.&nbsp; And so be I; and by your tongue you come
from my neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you would hardly have heard of me,&rsquo; he said quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My time would be long before yours, ma&rsquo;am, you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect
of stopping her cross-examination.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is only one thing more wanted to make me happy,&rsquo;
continued the new-comer.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that is a little baccy, which
I am sorry to say I am out of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fill your pipe,&rsquo; said the shepherd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A smoker, and no pipe about &lsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have dropped it somewhere on the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe, saying, as he
did so, &lsquo;Hand me your baccy-box&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fill that too,
now I am about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man went through the movement of searching his pockets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lost that too?&rsquo; said his entertainer, with some surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid so,&rsquo; said the man with some confusion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Give it to me in a screw of paper.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lighting his
pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the
bowl, he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the
faint steam from his damp legs, as if he wished to say no more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice
of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were
engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance.&nbsp; The matter
being settled, they were about to stand up when an interruption came
in the shape of another knock at the door.</p>
<p>At sound of the same the man in the chimney-corner took up the poker
and began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one
aim of his existence; and a second time the shepherd said, &lsquo;Walk
in!&rsquo;&nbsp; In a moment another man stood upon the straw-woven
door-mat.&nbsp; He too was a stranger.</p>
<p>This individual was one of a type radically different from the first.&nbsp;
There was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial
cosmopolitanism sat upon his features.&nbsp; He was several years older
than the first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows
bristly, and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks.&nbsp; His face was
rather full and flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without
power.&nbsp; A few grog-blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose.&nbsp;
He flung back his long drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he
wore a suit of cinder-gray shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some
metal or other that would take a polish, dangling from his fob as his
only personal ornament.&nbsp; Shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned
glazed hat, he said, &lsquo;I must ask for a few minutes&rsquo; shelter,
comrades, or I shall be wetted to my skin before I get to Casterbridge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make yourself at home, master,&rsquo; said the shepherd, perhaps
a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion.&nbsp; Not that Fennel
had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition; but the room
was far from large, spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions
were not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls
in their bright-coloured gowns.</p>
<p>However, the second comer, after taking off his greatcoat, and hanging
his hat on a nail in one of the ceiling-beams as if he had been specially
invited to put it there, advanced and sat down at the table.&nbsp; This
had been pushed so closely into the chimney-corner, to give all available
room to the dancers, that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man
who had ensconced himself by the fire; and thus the two strangers were
brought into close companionship.&nbsp; They nodded to each other by
way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance, and the first stranger handed
his neighbour the family mug&mdash;a huge vessel of brown ware, having
its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations
of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh, and bearing the
following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters</p>
<blockquote><p>THERE IS NO FUN<br />
UNTiLL i CUM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other man, nothing loth, raised the mug to his lips, and drank
on, and on, and on&mdash;till a curious blueness overspread the countenance
of the shepherd&rsquo;s wife, who had regarded with no little surprise
the first stranger&rsquo;s free offer to the second of what did not
belong to him to dispense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it!&rsquo; said the toper to the shepherd with much
satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I walked up your garden before coming
in, and saw the hives all of a row, I said to myself; &ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s
bees there&rsquo;s honey, and where there&rsquo;s honey there&rsquo;s
mead.&rdquo;&nbsp; But mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this
I really didn&rsquo;t expect to meet in my older days.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He took yet another pull at the mug, till it assumed an ominous elevation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad you enjoy it!&rsquo; said the shepherd warmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is goodish mead,&rsquo; assented Mrs. Fennel, with an absence
of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise
for one&rsquo;s cellar at too heavy a price.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is trouble
enough to make&mdash;and really I hardly think we shall make any more.&nbsp;
For honey sells well, and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o&rsquo;
small mead and metheglin for common use from the comb-washings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, but you&rsquo;ll never have the heart!&rsquo; reproachfully
cried the stranger in cinder-gray, after taking up the mug a third time
and setting it down empty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I love mead, when &rsquo;tis
old like this, as I love to go to church o&rsquo; Sundays, or to relieve
the needy any day of the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; said the man in the chimney-corner, who,
in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco, could not
or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrade&rsquo;s
humour.</p>
<p>Now the old mead of those days, brewed of the purest first-year or
maiden honey, four pounds to the gallon&mdash;with its due complement
of white of eggs, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, rosemary, yeast, and
processes of working, bottling, and cellaring&mdash;tasted remarkably
strong; but it did not taste so strong as it actually was.&nbsp; Hence,
presently, the stranger in cinder-gray at the table, moved by its creeping
influence, unbuttoned his waistcoat, threw himself back in his chair,
spread his legs, and made his presence felt in various ways.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, as I say,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;I am going
to Casterbridge, and to Casterbridge I must go.&nbsp; I should have
been almost there by this time; but the rain drove me into your dwelling,
and I&rsquo;m not sorry for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t live in Casterbridge?&rsquo; said the shepherd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as yet; though I shortly mean to move there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going to set up in trade, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the shepherd&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is easy to see that the gentleman is rich, and don&rsquo;t want to work
at anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cinder-gray stranger paused, as if to consider whether he would
accept that definition of himself.&nbsp; He presently rejected it by
answering, &lsquo;Rich is not quite the word for me, dame.&nbsp; I do
work, and I must work.&nbsp; And even if I only get to Casterbridge
by midnight I must begin work there at eight to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
Yes, het or wet, blow or snow, famine or sword, my day&rsquo;s work
to-morrow must be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor man!&nbsp; Then, in spite o&rsquo; seeming, you be worse
off than we?&rsquo; replied the shepherd&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the nature of my trade, men and maidens.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty . . . But really
and truly I must up and off, or I shan&rsquo;t get a lodging in the
town.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, the speaker did not move, and directly added,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s time for one more draught of friendship before
I go; and I&rsquo;d perform it at once if the mug were not dry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a mug o&rsquo; small,&rsquo; said Mrs. Fennel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Small, we call it, though to be sure &rsquo;tis only the first
wash o&rsquo; the combs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the stranger disdainfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
won&rsquo;t spoil your first kindness by partaking o&rsquo; your second.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; broke in Fennel.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t
increase and multiply every day, and I&rsquo;ll fill the mug again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood.&nbsp;
The shepherdess followed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you do this?&rsquo; she said reproachfully, as
soon as they were alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s emptied it once, though
it held enough for ten people; and now he&rsquo;s not contented wi&rsquo;
the small, but must needs call for more o&rsquo; the strong!&nbsp; And
a stranger unbeknown to any of us.&nbsp; For my part, I don&rsquo;t
like the look o&rsquo; the man at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s in the house, my honey; and &rsquo;tis a wet
night, and a christening.&nbsp; Daze it, what&rsquo;s a cup of mead
more or less?&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be plenty more next bee-burning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;this time, then,&rsquo; she answered, looking
wistfully at the barrel.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what is the man&rsquo;s calling,
and where is he one of; that he should come in and join us like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask him again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the
stranger in cinder-gray was effectually guarded against this time by
Mrs. Fennel.&nbsp; She poured out his allowance in a small cup, keeping
the large one at a discreet distance from him.&nbsp; When he had tossed
off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about the stranger&rsquo;s
occupation.</p>
<p>The latter did not immediately reply, and the man in the chimney-corner,
with sudden demonstrativeness, said, &lsquo;Anybody may know my trade&mdash;I&rsquo;m
a wheelwright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very good trade for these parts,&rsquo; said the shepherd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And anybody may know mine&mdash;if they&rsquo;ve the sense
to find it out,&rsquo; said the stranger in cinder-gray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may generally tell what a man is by his claws,&rsquo;
observed the hedge-carpenter, looking at his own hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
fingers be as full of thorns as an old pin-cushion is of pins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hands of the man in the chimney-corner instinctively sought the
shade, and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe.&nbsp; The
man at the table took up the hedge-carpenter&rsquo;s remark, and added
smartly, &lsquo;True; but the oddity of my trade is that, instead of
setting a mark upon me, it sets a mark upon my customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma,
the shepherd&rsquo;s wife once more called for a song.&nbsp; The same
obstacles presented themselves as at the former time&mdash;one had no
voice, another had forgotten the first verse.&nbsp; The stranger at
the table, whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature, relieved
the difficulty by exclaiming that, to start the company, he would sing
himself.&nbsp; Thrusting one thumb into the arm-hole of his waistcoat,
he waved the other hand in the air, and, with an extemporizing gaze
at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece, began:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O my trade it is the rarest
one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple shepherds all
-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My trade is a sight to see;<br />
For my customers I tie, and take them up on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And waft &rsquo;em to a far countree!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room was silent when he had finished the verse&mdash;with one
exception, that of the man in the chimney-corner, who, at the singer&rsquo;s
word, &lsquo;Chorus! &lsquo;joined him in a deep bass voice of musical
relish -</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And waft &rsquo;em to a far countree!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver Giles, John Pitcher the dairyman, the parish-clerk, the engaged
man of fifty, the row of young women against the wall, seemed lost in
thought not of the gayest kind.&nbsp; The shepherd looked meditatively
on the ground, the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer, and with
some suspicion; she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing
an old song from recollection, or was composing one there and then for
the occasion.&nbsp; All were as perplexed at the obscure revelation
as the guests at Belshazzar&rsquo;s Feast, except the man in the chimney-corner,
who quietly said, &lsquo;Second verse, stranger,&rsquo; and smoked on.</p>
<p>The singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards, and
went on with the next stanza as requested:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;My tools are but common ones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple shepherds all
-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tools are no sight to see:<br />
A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are implements enough for me!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shepherd Fennel glanced round.&nbsp; There was no longer any doubt
that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically.&nbsp; The
guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations.&nbsp;
The young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted half-way, and would
have proceeded, but finding him wanting in alacrity for catching her
she sat down trembling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he&rsquo;s the&mdash;!&rsquo; whispered the people in the
background, mentioning the name of an ominous public officer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s come to do it!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be at Casterbridge
jail to-morrow&mdash;the man for sheep-stealing&mdash;the poor clock-maker
we heard of; who used to live away at Shottsford and had no work to
do&mdash;Timothy Summers, whose family were a-starving, and so he went
out of Shottsford by the high-road, and took a sheep in open daylight,
defying the farmer and the farmer&rsquo;s wife and the farmer&rsquo;s
lad, and every man jack among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He&rsquo; (and they nodded
towards the stranger of the deadly trade) &lsquo;is come from up the
country to do it because there&rsquo;s not enough to do in his own county-town,
and he&rsquo;s got the place here now our own county man&rsquo;s dead;
he&rsquo;s going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stranger in cinder-gray took no notice of this whispered string
of observations, but again wetted his lips.&nbsp; Seeing that his friend
in the chimney-corner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality
in any way, he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade, who
also held out his own.&nbsp; They clinked together, the eyes of the
rest of the room hanging upon the singer&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp; He parted
his lips for the third verse; but at that moment another knock was audible
upon the door.&nbsp; This time the knock was faint and hesitating.</p>
<p>The company seemed scared; the shepherd looked with consternation
towards the entrance, and it was with some effort that he resisted his
alarmed wife&rsquo;s deprecatory glance, and uttered for the third time
the welcoming words, &lsquo;Walk in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The door was gently opened, and another man stood upon the mat.&nbsp;
He, like those who had preceded him, was a stranger.&nbsp; This time
it was a short, small personage, of fair complexion, and dressed in
a decent suit of dark clothes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you tell me the way to&mdash;?&rsquo; he began: when,
gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company amongst whom
he had fallen, his eyes lighted on the stranger in cinder-gray.&nbsp;
It was just at the instant when the latter, who had thrown his mind
into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption,
silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To-morrow is my working day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple shepherds all
-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow is a working day for me:<br />
For the farmer&rsquo;s sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta&rsquo;en,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his soul may God ha&rsquo; merc-y!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stranger in the chimney-corner, waving cups with the singer so
heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth, repeated in his
bass voice as before:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And on his soul may God ha&rsquo; merc-y!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway.&nbsp;
Finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests
particularly regarded him.&nbsp; They noticed to their surprise that
he stood before them the picture of abject terror&mdash;his knees trembling,
his hand shaking so violently that the door-latch by which he supported
himself rattled audibly: his white lips were parted, and his eyes fixed
on the merry officer of justice in the middle of the room.&nbsp; A moment
more and he had turned, closed the door, and fled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a man can it be?&rsquo; said the shepherd.</p>
<p>The rest, between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd
conduct of this third visitor, looked as if they knew not what to think,
and said nothing.&nbsp; Instinctively they withdrew further and further
from the grim gentleman in their midst, whom some of them seemed to
take for the Prince of Darkness himself; till they formed a remote circle,
an empty space of floor being left between them and him -</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo; . . . circulus, cujus centrum diabolus.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room was so silent&mdash;though there were more than twenty people
in it&mdash;that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against
the window-shutters, accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop
that fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of
the man in the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of long clay.</p>
<p>The stillness was unexpectedly broken.&nbsp; The distant sound of
a gun reverberated through the air&mdash;apparently from the direction
of the county-town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be jiggered!&rsquo; cried the stranger who had sung the song,
jumping up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does that mean?&rsquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A prisoner escaped from the jail&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it
means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All listened.&nbsp; The sound was repeated, and none of them spoke
but the man in the chimney-corner, who said quietly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times; but
I never heard it till now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if it is <i>my</i> man?&rsquo; murmured the personage
in cinder-gray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely it is!&rsquo; said the shepherd involuntarily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And surely we&rsquo;ve zeed him!&nbsp; That little man who looked
in at the door by now, and quivered like a leaf when he zeed ye and
heard your song!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His teeth chattered, and the breath went out of his body,&rsquo;
said the dairyman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone,&rsquo;
said Oliver Giles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he bolted as if he&rsquo;d been shot at,&rsquo; said the
hedge-carpenter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;True&mdash;his teeth chattered, and his heart seemed to sink;
and he bolted as if he&rsquo;d been shot at,&rsquo; slowly summed up
the man in the chimney-corner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice it,&rsquo; remarked the hangman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were all a-wondering what made him run off in such a fright,&rsquo;
faltered one of the women against the wall, &lsquo;and now &rsquo;tis
explained!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The firing of the alarm-gun went on at intervals, low and sullenly,
and their suspicions became a certainty.&nbsp; The sinister gentleman
in cinder-gray roused himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is there a constable here?&rsquo;
he asked, in thick tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;If so, let him step forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall, his
betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a sworn constable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then pursue the criminal at once, with assistance, and bring
him back here.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t have gone far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, sir, I will&mdash;when I&rsquo;ve got my staff.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go home and get it, and come sharp here, and start in a body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Staff!&mdash;never mind your staff; the man&rsquo;ll be gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t do nothing without my staff&mdash;can I,
William, and John, and Charles Jake?&nbsp; No; for there&rsquo;s the
king&rsquo;s royal crown a painted on en in yaller and gold, and the
lion and the unicorn, so as when I raise en up and hit my prisoner,
&rsquo;tis made a lawful blow thereby.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;tempt
to take up a man without my staff&mdash;no, not I.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t
the law to gie me courage, why, instead o&rsquo; my taking up him he
might take up me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;m a king&rsquo;s man myself; and can give you
authority enough for this,&rsquo; said the formidable officer in gray.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now then, all of ye, be ready.&nbsp; Have ye any lanterns?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;have ye any lanterns?&mdash;I demand it!&rsquo;
said the constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the rest of you able-bodied&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Able-bodied men&mdash;yes&mdash;the rest of ye!&rsquo; said
the constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you some good stout staves and pitch-forks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Staves and pitchforks&mdash;in the name o&rsquo; the law!&nbsp;
And take &rsquo;em in yer hands and go in quest, and do as we in authority
tell ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase.&nbsp; The evidence
was, indeed, though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument
was needed to show the shepherd&rsquo;s guests that after what they
had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly
pursue the unhappy third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more
than a few hundred yards over such uneven country.</p>
<p>A shepherd is always well provided with lanterns; and, lighting these
hastily, and with hurdle-staves in their hands, they poured out of the
door, taking a direction along the crest of the hill, away from the
town, the rain having fortunately a little abated.</p>
<p>Disturbed by the noise, or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism,
the child who had been christened began to cry heart-brokenly in the
room overhead.&nbsp; These notes of grief came down through the chinks
of the floor to the ears of the women below, who jumped up one by one,
and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby, for the
incidents of the last half-hour greatly oppressed them.&nbsp; Thus in
the space of two or three minutes the room on the ground-floor was deserted
quite.</p>
<p>But it was not for long.&nbsp; Hardly had the sound of footsteps
died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the
direction the pursuers had taken.&nbsp; Peeping in at the door, and
seeing nobody there, he entered leisurely.&nbsp; It was the stranger
of the chimney-corner, who had gone out with the rest.&nbsp; The motive
of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmer-cake
that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat, and which he had apparently
forgotten to take with him.&nbsp; He also poured out half a cup more
mead from the quantity that remained, ravenously eating and drinking
these as he stood.&nbsp; He had not finished when another figure came
in just as quietly&mdash;his friend in cinder-gray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;you here?&rsquo; said the latter, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
thought you had gone to help in the capture.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this speaker
also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round
for the fascinating mug of old mead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I thought you had gone,&rsquo; said the other, continuing
his skimmer-cake with some effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, on second thoughts, I felt there were enough without
me,&rsquo; said the first confidentially, &lsquo;and such a night as
it is, too.&nbsp; Besides, &rsquo;tis the business o&rsquo; the Government
to take care of its criminals&mdash;not mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; so it is.&nbsp; And I felt as you did, that there were
enough without me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to break my limbs running over the humps
and hollows of this wild country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I neither, between you and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These shepherd-people are used to it&mdash;simple-minded souls,
you know, stirred up to anything in a moment.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll have
him ready for me before the morning, and no trouble to me at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ll have him, and we shall have saved ourselves
all labour in the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, true.&nbsp; Well, my way is to Casterbridge; and &rsquo;tis
as much as my legs will do to take me that far.&nbsp; Going the same
way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am sorry to say!&nbsp; I have to get home over there&rsquo;
(he nodded indefinitely to the right), &lsquo;and I feel as you do,
that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other had by this time finished the mead in the mug, after which,
shaking hands heartily at the door, and wishing each other well, they
went their several ways.</p>
<p>In the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the
hog&rsquo;s-back elevation which dominated this part of the down.&nbsp;
They had decided on no particular plan of action; and, finding that
the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company, they seemed
quite unable to form any such plan now.&nbsp; They descended in all
directions down the hill, and straightway several of the party fell
into the snare set by Nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over
this part of the cretaceous formation.&nbsp; The &lsquo;lanchets,&rsquo;
or flint slopes, which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen
yards, took the less cautious ones unawares, and losing their footing
on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards, the lanterns rolling
from their hands to the bottom, and there lying on their sides till
the horn was scorched through.</p>
<p>When they had again gathered themselves together, the shepherd, as
the man who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round
these treacherous inclines.&nbsp; The lanterns, which seemed rather
to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the
exploration, were extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this
more rational order they plunged into the vale.&nbsp; It was a grassy,
briery, moist defile, affording some shelter to any person who had sought
it; but the party perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other
side.&nbsp; Here they wandered apart, and after an interval closed together
again to report progress.</p>
<p>At the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely
ash, the single tree on this part of the coomb, probably sown there
by a passing bird some fifty years before.&nbsp; And here, standing
a little to one side of the trunk, as motionless as the trunk itself;
appeared the man they were in quest of; his outline being well defined
against the sky beyond.&nbsp; The band noiselessly drew up and faced
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your money or your life!&rsquo; said the constable sternly
to the still figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; whispered John Pitcher.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
our side ought to say that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the doctrine of vagabonds
like him, and we be on the side of the law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; replied the constable impatiently; &lsquo;I
must say something, mustn&rsquo;t I? and if you had all the weight o&rsquo;
this undertaking upon your mind, perhaps you&rsquo;d say the wrong thing
too!&mdash;Prisoner at the bar, surrender, in the name of the Father&mdash;the
Crown, I mane!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time,
and, giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage,
he strolled slowly towards them.&nbsp; He was, indeed, the little man,
the third stranger; but his trepidation had in a great measure gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, travellers,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;did I hear ye speak
to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did: you&rsquo;ve got to come and be our prisoner at once!&rsquo;
said the constable.&nbsp; &lsquo;We arrest &lsquo;ee on the charge of
not biding in Casterbridge jail in a decent proper manner to be hung
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Neighbours, do your duty, and seize the culpet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On hearing the charge, the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not
another word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search-party,
who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides,
and marched him back towards the shepherd&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock by the time they arrived.&nbsp; The light
shining from the open door, a sound of men&rsquo;s voices within, proclaimed
to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen
in their absence.&nbsp; On entering they discovered the shepherd&rsquo;s
living room to be invaded by two officers from Casterbridge jail, and
a well-known magistrate who lived at the nearest country-seat, intelligence
of the escape having become generally circulated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the constable, &lsquo;I have brought
back your man&mdash;not without risk and danger; but every one must
do his duty!&nbsp; He is inside this circle of able-bodied persons,
who have lent me useful aid, considering their ignorance of Crown work.&nbsp;
Men, bring forward your prisoner!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the third stranger
was led to the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is this?&rsquo; said one of the officials.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man,&rsquo; said the constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said the turnkey; and the first corroborated
his statement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how can it be otherwise?&rsquo; asked the constable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Or why was he so terrified at sight o&rsquo; the singing instrument
of the law who sat there?&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he related the strange behaviour
of the third stranger on entering the house during the hangman&rsquo;s
song.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t understand it,&rsquo; said the officer coolly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All I know is that it is not the condemned man.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
quite a different character from this one; a gauntish fellow, with dark
hair and eyes, rather good-looking, and with a musical bass voice that
if you heard it once you&rsquo;d never mistake as long as you lived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, souls&mdash;&rsquo;twas the man in the chimney-corner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey&mdash;what?&rsquo; said the magistrate, coming forward
after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got the man after all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said the constable, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s the
man we were in search of, that&rsquo;s true; and yet he&rsquo;s not
the man we were in search of.&nbsp; For the man we were in search of
was not the man we wanted, sir, if you understand my everyday way; for
&rsquo;twas the man in the chimney-corner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty kettle of fish altogether!&rsquo; said the magistrate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You had better start for the other man at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner now spoke for the first time.&nbsp; The mention of the
man in the chimney-corner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could
do.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he said, stepping forward to the magistrate,
&lsquo;take no more trouble about me.&nbsp; The time is come when I
may as well speak.&nbsp; I have done nothing; my crime is that the condemned
man is my brother.&nbsp; Early this afternoon I left home at Shottsford
to tramp it all the way to Casterbridge jail to bid him farewell.&nbsp;
I was benighted, and called here to rest and ask the way.&nbsp; When
I opened the door I saw before me the very man, my brother, that I thought
to see in the condemned cell at Casterbridge.&nbsp; He was in this chimney-corner;
and jammed close to him, so that he could not have got out if he had
tried, was the executioner who&rsquo;d come to take his life, singing
a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close
by, joining in to save appearances.&nbsp; My brother looked a glance
of agony at me, and I knew he meant, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reveal what
you see; my life depends on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was so terror-struck
that I could hardly stand, and, not knowing what I did, I turned and
hurried away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The narrator&rsquo;s manner and tone had the stamp of truth, and
his story made a great impression on all around.&nbsp; &lsquo;And do
you know where your brother is at the present time?&rsquo; asked the
magistrate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not.&nbsp; I have never seen him since I closed this
door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can testify to that, for we&rsquo;ve been between ye ever
since,&rsquo; said the constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where does he think to fly to?&mdash;what is his occupation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a watch-and-clock-maker, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;A said &rsquo;a was a wheelwright&mdash;a wicked rogue,&rsquo;
said the constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wheels of clocks and watches he meant, no doubt,&rsquo;
said Shepherd Fennel.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought his hands were palish for&rsquo;s
trade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining
this poor man in custody,&rsquo; said the magistrate; &lsquo;your business
lies with the other, unquestionably.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing
the less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate
or constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they
concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself.&nbsp;
When this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found
to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search
before the next morning.</p>
<p>Next day, accordingly, the quest for the clever sheep-stealer became
general and keen, to all appearance at least.&nbsp; But the intended
punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression, and the
sympathy of a great many country-folk in that district was strongly
on the side of the fugitive.&nbsp; Moreover, his marvellous coolness
and daring in hob-and-nobbing with the hangman, under the unprecedented
circumstances of the shepherd&rsquo;s party, won their admiration.&nbsp;
So that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves
so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough
when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses.&nbsp;
Stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in
some old overgrown trackway or other, remote from turnpike roads; but
when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody
was found.&nbsp; Thus the days and weeks passed without tidings.</p>
<p>In brief; the bass-voiced man of the chimney-corner was never recaptured.&nbsp;
Some said that he went across the sea, others that he did not, but buried
himself in the depths of a populous city.&nbsp; At any rate, the gentleman
in cinder-gray never did his morning&rsquo;s work at Casterbridge, nor
met anywhere at all, for business purposes, the genial comrade with
whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the
coomb.</p>
<p>The grass has long been green on the graves of Shepherd Fennel and
his frugal wife; the guests who made up the christening party have mainly
followed their entertainers to the tomb; the baby in whose honour they
all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf.&nbsp; But the arrival
of the three strangers at the shepherd&rsquo;s that night, and the details
connected therewith, is a story as well known as ever in the country
about Higher Crowstairs.</p>
<p>March 1883.</p>
<h2>THE WITHERED ARM</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;A LORN MILKMAID</h3>
<p>It was an eighty-cow dairy, and the troop of milkers, regular and
supernumerary, were all at work; for, though the time of year was as
yet but early April, the feed lay entirely in water-meadows, and the
cows were &lsquo;in full pail.&rsquo;&nbsp; The hour was about six in
the evening, and three-fourths of the large, red, rectangular animals
having been finished off, there was opportunity for a little conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He do bring home his bride to-morrow, I hear.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
come as far as Anglebury to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice seemed to proceed from the belly of the cow called Cherry,
but the speaker was a milking-woman, whose face was buried in the flank
of that motionless beast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hav&rsquo; anybody seen her?&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>There was a negative response from the first.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though
they say she&rsquo;s a rosy-cheeked, tisty-tosty little body enough,&rsquo;
she added; and as the milkmaid spoke she turned her face so that she
could glance past her cow&rsquo;s tail to the other side of the barton,
where a thin, fading woman of thirty milked somewhat apart from the
rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Years younger than he, they say,&rsquo; continued the second,
with also a glance of reflectiveness in the same direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old do you call him, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty or so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More like forty,&rsquo; broke in an old milkman near, in a
long white pinafore or &lsquo;wropper,&rsquo; and with the brim of his
hat tied down, so that he looked like a woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;A
was born before our Great Weir was builded, and I hadn&rsquo;t man&rsquo;s
wages when I laved water there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The discussion waxed so warm that the purr of the milk-streams became
jerky, till a voice from another cow&rsquo;s belly cried with authority,
&lsquo;Now then, what the Turk do it matter to us about Farmer Lodge&rsquo;s
age, or Farmer Lodge&rsquo;s new mis&rsquo;ess?&nbsp; I shall have to
pay him nine pound a year for the rent of every one of these milchers,
whatever his age or hers.&nbsp; Get on with your work, or &rsquo;twill
be dark afore we have done.&nbsp; The evening is pinking in a&rsquo;ready.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This speaker was the dairyman himself; by whom the milkmaids and men
were employed.</p>
<p>Nothing more was said publicly about Farmer Lodge&rsquo;s wedding,
but the first woman murmured under her cow to her next neighbour, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
hard for <i>she</i>,&rsquo; signifying the thin worn milkmaid aforesaid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said the second.&nbsp; &lsquo;He ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
spoke to Rhoda Brook for years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the milking was done they washed their pails and hung them on
a many-forked stand made of the peeled limb of an oak-tree, set upright
in the earth, and resembling a colossal antlered horn.&nbsp; The majority
then dispersed in various directions homeward.&nbsp; The thin woman
who had not spoken was joined by a boy of twelve or thereabout, and
the twain went away up the field also.</p>
<p>Their course lay apart from that of the others, to a lonely spot
high above the water-meads, and not far from the border of Egdon Heath,
whose dark countenance was visible in the distance as they drew nigh
to their home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve just been saying down in barton that your father
brings his young wife home from Anglebury to-morrow,&rsquo; the woman
observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall want to send you for a few things to
market, and you&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to meet &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mother,&rsquo; said the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is father married
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . You can give her a look, and tell me what&rsquo;s
she&rsquo;s like, if you do see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she&rsquo;s dark or fair, and if she&rsquo;s tall&mdash;as
tall as I.&nbsp; And if she seems like a woman who has ever worked for
a living, or one that has been always well off, and has never done anything,
and shows marks of the lady on her, as I expect she do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They crept up the hill in the twilight, and entered the cottage.&nbsp;
It was built of mud-walls, the surface of which had been washed by many
rains into channels and depressions that left none of the original flat
face visible; while here and there in the thatch above a rafter showed
like a bone protruding through the skin.</p>
<p>She was kneeling down in the chimney-corner, before two pieces of
turf laid together with the heather inwards, blowing at the red-hot
ashes with her breath till the turves flamed.&nbsp; The radiance lit
her pale cheek, and made her dark eyes, that had once been handsome,
seem handsome anew.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she resumed, &lsquo;see
if she is dark or fair, and if you can, notice if her hands be white;
if not, see if they look as though she had ever done housework, or are
milker&rsquo;s hands like mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy again promised, inattentively this time, his mother not observing
that he was cutting a notch with his pocket-knife in the beech-backed
chair.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE YOUNG WIFE</h3>
<p>The road from Anglebury to Holmstoke is in general level; but there
is one place where a sharp ascent breaks its monotony.&nbsp; Farmers
homeward-bound from the former market-town, who trot all the rest of
the way, walk their horses up this short incline.</p>
<p>The next evening, while the sun was yet bright, a handsome new gig,
with a lemon-coloured body and red wheels, was spinning westward along
the level highway at the heels of a powerful mare.&nbsp; The driver
was a yeoman in the prime of life, cleanly shaven like an actor, his
face being toned to that bluish-vermilion hue which so often graces
a thriving farmer&rsquo;s features when returning home after successful
dealings in the town.&nbsp; Beside him sat a woman, many years his junior&mdash;almost,
indeed, a girl.&nbsp; Her face too was fresh in colour, but it was of
a totally different quality&mdash;soft and evanescent, like the light
under a heap of rose-petals.</p>
<p>Few people travelled this way, for it was not a main road; and the
long white riband of gravel that stretched before them was empty, save
of one small scarce-moving speck, which presently resolved itself into
the figure of boy, who was creeping on at a snail&rsquo;s pace, and
continually looking behind him&mdash;the heavy bundle he carried being
some excuse for, if not the reason of, his dilatoriness.&nbsp; When
the bouncing gig-party slowed at the bottom of the incline above mentioned,
the pedestrian was only a few yards in front.&nbsp; Supporting the large
bundle by putting one hand on his hip, he turned and looked straight
at the farmer&rsquo;s wife as though he would read her through and through,
pacing along abreast of the horse.</p>
<p>The low sun was full in her face, rendering every feature, shade,
and contour distinct, from the curve of her little nostril to the colour
of her eyes.&nbsp; The farmer, though he seemed annoyed at the boy&rsquo;s
persistent presence, did not order him to get out of the way; and thus
the lad preceded them, his hard gaze never leaving her, till they reached
the top of the ascent, when the farmer trotted on with relief in his
lineaments&mdash;having taken no outward notice of the boy whatever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How that poor lad stared at me!&rsquo; said the young wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear; I saw that he did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is one of the village, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I think he lives with his
mother a mile or two off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He knows who we are, no doubt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; You must expect to be stared at just at first,
my pretty Gertrude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&mdash;though I think the poor boy may have looked at
us in the hope we might relieve him of his heavy load, rather than from
curiosity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said her husband off-handedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;These
country lads will carry a hundredweight once they get it on their backs;
besides his pack had more size than weight in it.&nbsp; Now, then, another
mile and I shall be able to show you our house in the distance&mdash;if
it is not too dark before we get there.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wheels spun
round, and particles flew from their periphery as before, till a white
house of ample dimensions revealed itself, with farm-buildings and ricks
at the back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the boy had quickened his pace, and turning up a by-lane
some mile and half short of the white farmstead, ascended towards the
leaner pastures, and so on to the cottage of his mother.</p>
<p>She had reached home after her day&rsquo;s milking at the outlying
dairy, and was washing cabbage at the doorway in the declining light.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hold up the net a moment,&rsquo; she said, without preface, as
the boy came up.</p>
<p>He flung down his bundle, held the edge of the cabbage-net, and as
she filled its meshes with the dripping leaves she went on, &lsquo;Well,
did you see her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; quite plain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she ladylike?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and more.&nbsp; A lady complete.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she young?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s growed up, and her ways be quite a woman&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; What colour is her hair and face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her hair is lightish, and her face as comely as a live doll&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her eyes, then, are not dark like mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;of a bluish turn, and her mouth is very nice and
red; and when she smiles, her teeth show white.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she tall?&rsquo; said the woman sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see.&nbsp; She was sitting down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do you go to Holmstoke church to-morrow morning: she&rsquo;s
sure to be there.&nbsp; Go early and notice her walking in, and come
home and tell me if she&rsquo;s taller than I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, mother.&nbsp; But why don&rsquo;t you go and see
for yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;I</i> go to see her!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t look up at
her if she were to pass my window this instant.&nbsp; She was with Mr.
Lodge, of course.&nbsp; What did he say or do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just the same as usual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Took no notice of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day the mother put a clean shirt on the boy, and started him
off for Holmstoke church.&nbsp; He reached the ancient little pile when
the door was just being opened, and he was the first to enter.&nbsp;
Taking his seat by the font, he watched all the parishioners file in.&nbsp;
The well-to-do Farmer Lodge came nearly last; and his young wife, who
accompanied him, walked up the aisle with the shyness natural to a modest
woman who had appeared thus for the first time.&nbsp; As all other eyes
were fixed upon her, the youth&rsquo;s stare was not noticed now.</p>
<p>When he reached home his mother said, &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; before
he had entered the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not tall.&nbsp; She is rather short,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said his mother, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she&rsquo;s very pretty&mdash;very.&nbsp; In fact, she&rsquo;s
lovely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youthful freshness of the yeoman&rsquo;s wife had evidently made
an impression even on the somewhat hard nature of the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I want to hear,&rsquo; said his mother quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, spread the table-cloth.&nbsp; The hare you caught is very
tender; but mind that nobody catches you.&mdash;You&rsquo;ve never told
me what sort of hands she had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never seen &rsquo;em.&nbsp; She never took off her
gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did she wear this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A white bonnet and a silver-coloured gownd.&nbsp; It whewed
and whistled so loud when it rubbed against the pews that the lady coloured
up more than ever for very shame at the noise, and pulled it in to keep
it from touching; but when she pushed into her seat, it whewed more
than ever.&nbsp; Mr. Lodge, he seemed pleased, and his waistcoat stuck
out, and his great golden seals hung like a lord&rsquo;s; but she seemed
to wish her noisy gownd anywhere but on her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not she!&nbsp; However, that will do now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These descriptions of the newly-married couple were continued from
time to time by the boy at his mother&rsquo;s request, after any chance
encounter he had had with them.&nbsp; But Rhoda Brook, though she might
easily have seen young Mrs. Lodge for herself by walking a couple of
miles, would never attempt an excursion towards the quarter where the
farmhouse lay.&nbsp; Neither did she, at the daily milking in the dairyman&rsquo;s
yard on Lodge&rsquo;s outlying second farm, ever speak on the subject
of the recent marriage.&nbsp; The dairyman, who rented the cows of Lodge,
and knew perfectly the tall milkmaid&rsquo;s history, with manly kindliness
always kept the gossip in the cow-barton from annoying Rhoda.&nbsp;
But the atmosphere thereabout was full of the subject during the first
days of Mrs. Lodge&rsquo;s arrival; and from her boy&rsquo;s description
and the casual words of the other milkers, Rhoda Brook could raise a
mental image of the unconscious Mrs Lodge that was realistic as a photograph.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;A VISION</h3>
<p>One night, two or three weeks after the bridal return, when the boy
was gone to bed, Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she
had raked out in front of her to extinguish them.&nbsp; She contemplated
so intently the new wife, as presented to her in her mind&rsquo;s eye
over the embers, that she forgot the lapse of time.&nbsp; At last, wearied
with her day&rsquo;s work, she too retired.</p>
<p>But the figure which had occupied her so much during this and the
previous days was not to be banished at night.&nbsp; For the first time
Gertrude Lodge visited the supplanted woman in her dreams.&nbsp; Rhoda
Brook dreamed&mdash;since her assertion that she really saw, before
falling asleep, was not to be believed&mdash;that the young wife, in
the pale silk dress and white bonnet, but with features shockingly distorted,
and wrinkled as by age, was sitting upon her chest as she lay.&nbsp;
The pressure of Mrs. Lodge&rsquo;s person grew heavier; the blue eyes
peered cruelly into her face; and then the figure thrust forward its
left hand mockingly, so as to make the wedding-ring it wore glitter
in Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Maddened mentally, and nearly suffocated
by pressure, the sleeper struggled; the incubus, still regarding her,
withdrew to the foot of the bed, only, however, to come forward by degrees,
resume her seat, and flash her left hand as before.</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, Rhoda, in a last desperate effort, swung out
her right hand, seized the confronting spectre by its obtrusive left
arm, and whirled it backward to the floor, starting up herself as she
did so with a low cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, merciful heaven!&rsquo; she cried, sitting on the edge
of the bed in a cold sweat; &lsquo;that was not a dream&mdash;she was
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could feel her antagonist&rsquo;s arm within her grasp even now&mdash;the
very flesh and bone of it, as it seemed.&nbsp; She looked on the floor
whither she had whirled the spectre, but there was nothing to be seen.</p>
<p>Rhoda Brook slept no more that night, and when she went milking at
the next dawn they noticed how pale and haggard she looked.&nbsp; The
milk that she drew quivered into the pail; her hand had not calmed even
yet, and still retained the feel of the arm.&nbsp; She came home to
breakfast as wearily as if it had been suppertime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that noise in your chimmer, mother, last night?&rsquo;
said her son.&nbsp; &lsquo;You fell off the bed, surely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you hear anything fall?&nbsp; At what time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just when the clock struck two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not explain, and when the meal was done went silently about
her household work, the boy assisting her, for he hated going afield
on the farms, and she indulged his reluctance.&nbsp; Between eleven
and twelve the garden-gate clicked, and she lifted her eyes to the window.&nbsp;
At the bottom of the garden, within the gate, stood the woman of her
vision.&nbsp; Rhoda seemed transfixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, she said she would come!&rsquo; exclaimed the boy, also
observing her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Said so&mdash;when?&nbsp; How does she know us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen and spoken to her.&nbsp; I talked to her yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you,&rsquo; said the mother, flushing indignantly,
&lsquo;never to speak to anybody in that house, or go near the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not speak to her till she spoke to me.&nbsp; And I did
not go near the place.&nbsp; I met her in the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you tell her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Are you the poor boy who had
to bring the heavy load from market?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she looked at
my boots, and said they would not keep my feet dry if it came on wet,
because they were so cracked.&nbsp; I told her I lived with my mother,
and we had enough to do to keep ourselves, and that&rsquo;s how it was;
and she said then, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and bring you some better
boots, and see your mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gives away things to other
folks in the meads besides us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lodge was by this time close to the door&mdash;not in her silk,
as Rhoda had seen her in the bed-chamber, but in a morning hat, and
gown of common light material, which became her better than silk.&nbsp;
On her arm she carried a basket.</p>
<p>The impression remaining from the night&rsquo;s experience was still
strong.&nbsp; Brook had almost expected to see the wrinkles, the scorn,
and the cruelty on her visitor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>She would have escaped an interview, had escape been possible.&nbsp;
There was, however, no backdoor to the cottage, and in an instant the
boy had lifted the latch to Mrs. Lodge&rsquo;s gentle knock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see I have come to the right house,&rsquo; said she, glancing
at the lad, and smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I was not sure till you opened
the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The figure and action were those of the phantom; but her voice was
so indescribably sweet, her glance so winning, her smile so tender,
so unlike that of Rhoda&rsquo;s midnight visitant, that the latter could
hardly believe the evidence of her senses.&nbsp; She was truly glad
that she had not hidden away in sheer aversion, as she had been inclined
to do.&nbsp; In her basket Mrs. Lodge brought the pair of boots that
she had promised to the boy, and other useful articles.</p>
<p>At these proofs of a kindly feeling towards her and hers Rhoda&rsquo;s
heart reproached her bitterly.&nbsp; This innocent young thing should
have her blessing and not her curse.&nbsp; When she left them a light
seemed gone from the dwelling.&nbsp; Two days later she came again to
know if the boots fitted; and less than a fortnight after that paid
Rhoda another call.&nbsp; On this occasion the boy was absent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I walk a good deal,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lodge, &lsquo;and your
house is the nearest outside our own parish.&nbsp; I hope you are well.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t look quite well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda said she was well enough; and, indeed, though the paler of
the two, there was more of the strength that endures in her well-defined
features and large frame, than in the soft-cheeked young woman before
her.&nbsp; The conversation became quite confidential as regarded their
powers and weaknesses; and when Mrs. Lodge was leaving, Rhoda said,
&lsquo;I hope you will find this air agree with you, ma&rsquo;am, and
not suffer from the damp of the water-meads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The younger one replied that there was not much doubt of it, her
general health being usually good.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though, now you remind
me,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;I have one little ailment which puzzles
me.&nbsp; It is nothing serious, but I cannot make it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She uncovered her left hand and arm; and their outline confronted
Rhoda&rsquo;s gaze as the exact original of the limb she had beheld
and seized in her dream.&nbsp; Upon the pink round surface of the arm
were faint marks of an unhealthy colour, as if produced by a rough grasp.&nbsp;
Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes became riveted on the discolorations; she fancied
that she discerned in them the shape of her own four fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did it happen?&rsquo; she said mechanically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Lodge, shaking her head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;One night when I was sound asleep, dreaming I was away in some
strange place, a pain suddenly shot into my arm there, and was so keen
as to awaken me.&nbsp; I must have struck it in the daytime, I suppose,
though I don&rsquo;t remember doing so.&rsquo;&nbsp; She added, laughing,
&lsquo;I tell my dear husband that it looks just as if he had flown
into a rage and struck me there.&nbsp; O, I daresay it will soon disappear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp; Yes . . . On what night did it come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lodge considered, and said it would be a fortnight ago on the
morrow.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I awoke I could not remember where I was,&rsquo;
she added, &rsquo;till the clock striking two reminded me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had named the night and the hour of Rhoda&rsquo;s spectral encounter,
and Brook felt like a guilty thing.&nbsp; The artless disclosure startled
her; she did not reason on the freaks of coincidence; and all the scenery
of that ghastly night returned with double vividness to her mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, can it be,&rsquo; she said to herself, when her visitor
had departed, &lsquo;that I exercise a malignant power over people against
my own will?&rsquo;&nbsp; She knew that she had been slily called a
witch since her fall; but never having understood why that particular
stigma had been attached to her, it had passed disregarded.&nbsp; Could
this be the explanation, and had such things as this ever happened before?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A SUGGESTION</h3>
<p>The summer drew on, and Rhoda Brook almost dreaded to meet Mrs. Lodge
again, notwithstanding that her feeling for the young wife amounted
well-nigh to affection.&nbsp; Something in her own individuality seemed
to convict Rhoda of crime.&nbsp; Yet a fatality sometimes would direct
the steps of the latter to the outskirts of Holmstoke whenever she left
her house for any other purpose than her daily work; and hence it happened
that their next encounter was out of doors.&nbsp; Rhoda could not avoid
the subject which had so mystified her, and after the first few words
she stammered, &lsquo;I hope your&mdash;arm is well again, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;&nbsp;
She had perceived with consternation that Gertrude Lodge carried her
left arm stiffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; it is not quite well.&nbsp; Indeed it is no better at
all; it is rather worse.&nbsp; It pains me dreadfully sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you had better go to a doctor, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replied that she had already seen a doctor.&nbsp; Her husband
had insisted upon her going to one.&nbsp; But the surgeon had not seemed
to understand the afflicted limb at all; he had told her to bathe it
in hot water, and she had bathed it, but the treatment had done no good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you let me see it?&rsquo; said the milkwoman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lodge pushed up her sleeve and disclosed the place, which was
a few inches above the wrist.&nbsp; As soon as Rhoda Brook saw it, she
could hardly preserve her composure.&nbsp; There was nothing of the
nature of a wound, but the arm at that point had a shrivelled look,
and the outline of the four fingers appeared more distinct than at the
former time.&nbsp; Moreover, she fancied that they were imprinted in
precisely the relative position of her clutch upon the arm in the trance;
the first finger towards Gertrude&rsquo;s wrist, and the fourth towards
her elbow.</p>
<p>What the impress resembled seemed to have struck Gertrude herself
since their last meeting.&nbsp; &lsquo;It looks almost like finger-marks,&rsquo;
she said; adding with a faint laugh, &lsquo;my husband says it is as
if some witch, or the devil himself, had taken hold of me there, and
blasted the flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda shivered.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s fancy,&rsquo; she said
hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it, if I were you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t so much mind it,&rsquo; said the younger,
with hesitation, &lsquo;if&mdash;if I hadn&rsquo;t a notion that it
makes my husband&mdash;dislike me&mdash;no, love me less.&nbsp; Men
think so much of personal appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some do&mdash;he for one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and he was very proud of mine, at first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep your arm covered from his sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;he knows the disfigurement is there!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She tried to hide the tears that filled her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I earnestly hope it will go away soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so the milkwoman&rsquo;s mind was chained anew to the subject
by a horrid sort of spell as she returned home.&nbsp; The sense of having
been guilty of an act of malignity increased, affect as she might to
ridicule her superstition.&nbsp; In her secret heart Rhoda did not altogether
object to a slight diminution of her successor&rsquo;s beauty, by whatever
means it had come about; but she did not wish to inflict upon her physical
pain.&nbsp; For though this pretty young woman had rendered impossible
any reparation which Lodge might have made Rhoda for his past conduct,
everything like resentment at the unconscious usurpation had quite passed
away from the elder&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>If the sweet and kindly Gertrude Lodge only knew of the scene in
the bed-chamber, what would she think?&nbsp; Not to inform her of it
seemed treachery in the presence of her friendliness; but tell she could
not of her own accord&mdash;neither could she devise a remedy.</p>
<p>She mused upon the matter the greater part of the night; and the
next day, after the morning milking, set out to obtain another glimpse
of Gertrude Lodge if she could, being held to her by a gruesome fascination.&nbsp;
By watching the house from a distance the milkmaid was presently able
to discern the farmer&rsquo;s wife in a ride she was taking alone&mdash;probably
to join her husband in some distant field.&nbsp; Mrs. Lodge perceived
her, and cantered in her direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Rhoda!&rsquo; Gertrude said, when she had come
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was going to call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda noticed that Mrs. Lodge held the reins with some difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope&mdash;the bad arm,&rsquo; said Rhoda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They tell me there is possibly one way by which I might be
able to find out the cause, and so perhaps the cure, of it,&rsquo; replied
the other anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is by going to some clever man
over in Egdon Heath.&nbsp; They did not know if he was still alive&mdash;and
I cannot remember his name at this moment; but they said that you knew
more of his movements than anybody else hereabout, and could tell me
if he were still to be consulted.&nbsp; Dear me&mdash;what was his name?&nbsp;
But you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Conjuror Trendle?&rsquo; said her thin companion, turning
pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trendle&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Is he alive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe so,&rsquo; said Rhoda, with reluctance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you call him conjuror?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;they say&mdash;they used to say he was a&mdash;he
had powers other folks have not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, how could my people be so superstitious as to recommend
a man of that sort!&nbsp; I thought they meant some medical man.&nbsp;
I shall think no more of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda looked relieved, and Mrs. Lodge rode on.&nbsp; The milkwoman
had inwardly seen, from the moment she heard of her having been mentioned
as a reference for this man, that there must exist a sarcastic feeling
among the work-folk that a sorceress would know the whereabouts of the
exorcist.&nbsp; They suspected her, then.&nbsp; A short time ago this
would have given no concern to a woman of her common-sense.&nbsp; But
she had a haunting reason to be superstitious now; and she had been
seized with sudden dread that this Conjuror Trendle might name her as
the malignant influence which was blasting the fair person of Gertrude,
and so lead her friend to hate her for ever, and to treat her as some
fiend in human shape.</p>
<p>But all was not over.&nbsp; Two days after, a shadow intruded into
the window-pattern thrown on Rhoda Brook&rsquo;s floor by the afternoon
sun.&nbsp; The woman opened the door at once, almost breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you alone?&rsquo; said Gertrude.&nbsp; She seemed to be
no less harassed and anxious than Brook herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rhoda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The place on my arm seems worse, and troubles me!&rsquo; the
young farmer&rsquo;s wife went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is so mysterious!&nbsp;
I do hope it will not be an incurable wound.&nbsp; I have again been
thinking of what they said about Conjuror Trendle.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
really believe in such men, but I should not mind just visiting him,
from curiosity&mdash;though on no account must my husband know.&nbsp;
Is it far to where he lives?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;five miles,&rsquo; said Rhoda backwardly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In the heart of Egdon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I should have to walk.&nbsp; Could not you go with me
to show me the way&mdash;say to-morrow afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, not I&mdash;that is,&rsquo; the milkwoman murmured, with
a start of dismay.&nbsp; Again the dread seized her that something to
do with her fierce act in the dream might be revealed, and her character
in the eyes of the most useful friend she had ever had be ruined irretrievably.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lodge urged, and Rhoda finally assented, though with much misgiving.&nbsp;
Sad as the journey would be to her, she could not conscientiously stand
in the way of a possible remedy for her patron&rsquo;s strange affliction.&nbsp;
It was agreed that, to escape suspicion of their mystic intent, they
should meet at the edge of the heath at the corner of a plantation which
was visible from the spot where they now stood.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;CONJUROR TRENDLE</h3>
<p>By the next afternoon Rhoda would have done anything to escape this
inquiry.&nbsp; But she had promised to go.&nbsp; Moreover, there was
a horrid fascination at times in becoming instrumental in throwing such
possible light on her own character as would reveal her to be something
greater in the occult world than she had ever herself suspected.</p>
<p>She started just before the time of day mentioned between them, and
half-an-hour&rsquo;s brisk walking brought her to the south-eastern
extension of the Egdon tract of country, where the fir plantation was.&nbsp;
A slight figure, cloaked and veiled, was already there.&nbsp; Rhoda
recognized, almost with a shudder, that Mrs. Lodge bore her left arm
in a sling.</p>
<p>They hardly spoke to each other, and immediately set out on their
climb into the interior of this solemn country, which stood high above
the rich alluvial soil they had left half-an-hour before.&nbsp; It was
a long walk; thick clouds made the atmosphere dark, though it was as
yet only early afternoon; and the wind howled dismally over the hills
of the heath&mdash;not improbably the same heath which had witnessed
the agony of the Wessex King Ina, presented to after-ages as Lear.&nbsp;
Gertrude Lodge talked most, Rhoda replying with monosyllabic preoccupation.&nbsp;
She had a strange dislike to walking on the side of her companion where
hung the afflicted arm, moving round to the other when inadvertently
near it.&nbsp; Much heather had been brushed by their feet when they
descended upon a cart-track, beside which stood the house of the man
they sought.</p>
<p>He did not profess his remedial practices openly, or care anything
about their continuance, his direct interests being those of a dealer
in furze, turf, &lsquo;sharp sand,&rsquo; and other local products.&nbsp;
Indeed, he affected not to believe largely in his own powers, and when
warts that had been shown him for cure miraculously disappeared&mdash;which
it must be owned they infallibly did&mdash;he would say lightly, &lsquo;O,
I only drink a glass of grog upon &rsquo;em&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;s
all chance,&rsquo; and immediately turn the subject.</p>
<p>He was at home when they arrived, having in fact seen them descending
into his valley.&nbsp; He was a gray-bearded man, with a reddish face,
and he looked singularly at Rhoda the first moment he beheld her.&nbsp;
Mrs. Lodge told him her errand; and then with words of self-disparagement
he examined her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Medicine can&rsquo;t cure it,&rsquo; he said promptly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the work of an enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda shrank into herself, and drew back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An enemy?&nbsp; What enemy?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Lodge.</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s best known to yourself,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you like, I can show the person to you, though
I shall not myself know who it is.&nbsp; I can do no more; and don&rsquo;t
wish to do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pressed him; on which he told Rhoda to wait outside where she
stood, and took Mrs. Lodge into the room.&nbsp; It opened immediately
from the door; and, as the latter remained ajar, Rhoda Brook could see
the proceedings without taking part in them.&nbsp; He brought a tumbler
from the dresser, nearly filled it with water, and fetching an egg,
prepared it in some private way; after which he broke it on the edge
of the glass, so that the white went in and the yolk remained.&nbsp;
As it was getting gloomy, he took the glass and its contents to the
window, and told Gertrude to watch them closely.&nbsp; They leant over
the table together, and the milkwoman could see the opaline hue of the
egg-fluid changing form as it sank in the water, but she was not near
enough to define the shape that it assumed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you catch the likeness of any face or figure as you look?&rsquo;
demanded the conjuror of the young woman.</p>
<p>She murmured a reply, in tones so low as to be inaudible to Rhoda,
and continued to gaze intently into the glass.&nbsp; Rhoda turned, and
walked a few steps away.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Lodge came out, and her face was met by the light, it appeared
exceedingly pale&mdash;as pale as Rhoda&rsquo;s&mdash;against the sad
dun shades of the upland&rsquo;s garniture.&nbsp; Trendle shut the door
behind her, and they at once started homeward together.&nbsp; But Rhoda
perceived that her companion had quite changed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he charge much?&rsquo; she asked tentatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; He would not take a farthing,&rsquo;
said Gertrude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you see?&rsquo; inquired Rhoda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing I&mdash;care to speak of.&rsquo;&nbsp; The constraint
in her manner was remarkable; her face was so rigid as to wear an oldened
aspect, faintly suggestive of the face in Rhoda&rsquo;s bed-chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it you who first proposed coming here?&rsquo; Mrs. Lodge
suddenly inquired, after a long pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;How very odd, if
you did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; But I am not sorry we have come, all things considered,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; For the first time a sense of triumph possessed her,
and she did not altogether deplore that the young thing at her side
should learn that their lives had been antagonized by other influences
than their own.</p>
<p>The subject was no more alluded to during the long and dreary walk
home.&nbsp; But in some way or other a story was whispered about the
many-dairied lowland that winter that Mrs. Lodge&rsquo;s gradual loss
of the use of her left arm was owing to her being &lsquo;overlooked&rsquo;
by Rhoda Brook.&nbsp; The latter kept her own counsel about the incubus,
but her face grew sadder and thinner; and in the spring she and her
boy disappeared from the neighbourhood of Holmstoke.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A SECOND ATTEMPT</h3>
<p>Half-a-dozen years passed away, and Mr. and Mrs. Lodge&rsquo;s married
experience sank into prosiness, and worse.&nbsp; The farmer was usually
gloomy and silent: the woman whom he had wooed for her grace and beauty
was contorted and disfigured in the left limb; moreover, she had brought
him no child, which rendered it likely that he would be the last of
a family who had occupied that valley for some two hundred years.&nbsp;
He thought of Rhoda Brook and her son; and feared this might be a judgment
from heaven upon him.</p>
<p>The once blithe-hearted and enlightened Gertrude was changing into
an irritable, superstitious woman, whose whole time was given to experimenting
upon her ailment with every quack remedy she came across.&nbsp; She
was honestly attached to her husband, and was ever secretly hoping against
hope to win back his heart again by regaining some at least of her personal
beauty.&nbsp; Hence it arose that her closet was lined with bottles,
packets, and ointment-pots of every description&mdash;nay, bunches of
mystic herbs, charms, and books of necromancy, which in her schoolgirl
time she would have ridiculed as folly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damned if you won&rsquo;t poison yourself with these apothecary
messes and witch mixtures some time or other,&rsquo; said her husband,
when his eye chanced to fall upon the multitudinous array.</p>
<p>She did not reply, but turned her sad, soft glance upon him in such
heart-swollen reproach that he looked sorry for his words, and added,
&lsquo;I only meant it for your good, you know, Gertrude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll clear out the whole lot, and destroy them,&rsquo;
said she huskily, &lsquo;and try such remedies no more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want somebody to cheer you,&rsquo; he observed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I once thought of adopting a boy; but he is too old now.&nbsp;
And he is gone away I don&rsquo;t know where.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She guessed to whom he alluded; for Rhoda Brook&rsquo;s story had
in the course of years become known to her; though not a word had ever
passed between her husband and herself on the subject.&nbsp; Neither
had she ever spoken to him of her visit to Conjuror Trendle, and of
what was revealed to her, or she thought was revealed to her, by that
solitary heath-man.</p>
<p>She was now five-and-twenty; but she seemed older.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six years of marriage, and only a few months of love,&rsquo;
she sometimes whispered to herself.&nbsp; And then she thought of the
apparent cause, and said, with a tragic glance at her withering limb,
&lsquo;If I could only again be as I was when he first saw me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She obediently destroyed her nostrums and charms; but there remained
a hankering wish to try something else&mdash;some other sort of cure
altogether.&nbsp; She had never revisited Trendle since she had been
conducted to the house of the solitary by Rhoda against her will; but
it now suddenly occurred to Gertrude that she would, in a last desperate
effort at deliverance from this seeming curse, again seek out the man,
if he yet lived.&nbsp; He was entitled to a certain credence, for the
indistinct form he had raised in the glass had undoubtedly resembled
the only woman in the world who&mdash;as she now knew, though not then&mdash;could
have a reason for bearing her ill-will.&nbsp; The visit should be paid.</p>
<p>This time she went alone, though she nearly got lost on the heath,
and roamed a considerable distance out of her way.&nbsp; Trendle&rsquo;s
house was reached at last, however: he was not indoors, and instead
of waiting at the cottage, she went to where his bent figure was pointed
out to her at work a long way off.&nbsp; Trendle remembered her, and
laying down the handful of furze-roots which he was gathering and throwing
into a heap, he offered to accompany her in her homeward direction,
as the distance was considerable and the days were short.&nbsp; So they
walked together, his head bowed nearly to the earth, and his form of
a colour with it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can send away warts and other excrescences I know,&rsquo;
she said; &lsquo;why can&rsquo;t you send away this?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
the arm was uncovered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think too much of my powers!&rsquo; said Trendle; &lsquo;and
I am old and weak now, too.&nbsp; No, no; it is too much for me to attempt
in my own person.&nbsp; What have ye tried?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She named to him some of the hundred medicaments and counterspells
which she had adopted from time to time.&nbsp; He shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some were good enough,&rsquo; he said approvingly; &lsquo;but
not many of them for such as this.&nbsp; This is of the nature of a
blight, not of the nature of a wound; and if you ever do throw it off;
it will be all at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I only could!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is only one chance of doing it known to me.&nbsp; It
has never failed in kindred afflictions,&mdash;that I can declare.&nbsp;
But it is hard to carry out, and especially for a woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must touch with the limb the neck of a man who&rsquo;s
been hanged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started a little at the image he had raised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before he&rsquo;s cold&mdash;just after he&rsquo;s cut down,&rsquo;
continued the conjuror impassively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can that do good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will turn the blood and change the constitution.&nbsp;
But, as I say, to do it is hard.&nbsp; You must get into jail, and wait
for him when he&rsquo;s brought off the gallows.&nbsp; Lots have done
it, though perhaps not such pretty women as you.&nbsp; I used to send
dozens for skin complaints.&nbsp; But that was in former times.&nbsp;
The last I sent was in &lsquo;13&mdash;near twenty years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had no more to tell her; and, when he had put her into a straight
track homeward, turned and left her, refusing all money as at first.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;A RIDE</h3>
<p>The communication sank deep into Gertrude&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Her
nature was rather a timid one; and probably of all remedies that the
white wizard could have suggested there was not one which would have
filled her with so much aversion as this, not to speak of the immense
obstacles in the way of its adoption.</p>
<p>Casterbridge, the county-town, was a dozen or fifteen miles off;
and though in those days, when men were executed for horse-stealing,
arson, and burglary, an assize seldom passed without a hanging, it was
not likely that she could get access to the body of the criminal unaided.&nbsp;
And the fear of her husband&rsquo;s anger made her reluctant to breathe
a word of Trendle&rsquo;s suggestion to him or to anybody about him.</p>
<p>She did nothing for months, and patiently bore her disfigurement
as before.&nbsp; But her woman&rsquo;s nature, craving for renewed love,
through the medium of renewed beauty (she was but twenty-five), was
ever stimulating her to try what, at any rate, could hardly do her any
harm.&nbsp; &lsquo;What came by a spell will go by a spell surely,&rsquo;
she would say.&nbsp; Whenever her imagination pictured the act she shrank
in terror from the possibility of it: then the words of the conjuror,
&lsquo;It will turn your blood,&rsquo; were seen to be capable of a
scientific no less than a ghastly interpretation; the mastering desire
returned, and urged her on again.</p>
<p>There was at this time but one county paper, and that her husband
only occasionally borrowed.&nbsp; But old-fashioned days had old-fashioned
means, and news was extensively conveyed by word of mouth from market
to market, or from fair to fair, so that, whenever such an event as
an execution was about to take place, few within a radius of twenty
miles were ignorant of the coming sight; and, so far as Holmstoke was
concerned, some enthusiasts had been known to walk all the way to Casterbridge
and back in one day, solely to witness the spectacle.&nbsp; The next
assizes were in March; and when Gertrude Lodge heard that they had been
held, she inquired stealthily at the inn as to the result, as soon as
she could find opportunity.</p>
<p>She was, however, too late.&nbsp; The time at which the sentences
were to be carried out had arrived, and to make the journey and obtain
admission at such short notice required at least her husband&rsquo;s
assistance.&nbsp; She dared not tell him, for she had found by delicate
experiment that these smouldering village beliefs made him furious if
mentioned, partly because he half entertained them himself.&nbsp; It
was therefore necessary to wait for another opportunity.</p>
<p>Her determination received a fillip from learning that two epileptic
children had attended from this very village of Holmstoke many years
before with beneficial results, though the experiment had been strongly
condemned by the neighbouring clergy.&nbsp; April, May, June, passed;
and it is no overstatement to say that by the end of the last-named
month Gertrude well-nigh longed for the death of a fellow-creature.&nbsp;
Instead of her formal prayers each night, her unconscious prayer was,
&lsquo;O Lord, hang some guilty or innocent person soon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This time she made earlier inquiries, and was altogether more systematic
in her proceedings.&nbsp; Moreover, the season was summer, between the
haymaking and the harvest, and in the leisure thus afforded him her
husband had been holiday-taking away from home.</p>
<p>The assizes were in July, and she went to the inn as before.&nbsp;
There was to be one execution&mdash;only one&mdash;for arson.</p>
<p>Her greatest problem was not how to get to Casterbridge, but what
means she should adopt for obtaining admission to the jail.&nbsp; Though
access for such purposes had formerly never been denied, the custom
had fallen into desuetude; and in contemplating her possible difficulties,
she was again almost driven to fall back upon her husband.&nbsp; But,
on sounding him about the assizes, he was so uncommunicative, so more
than usually cold, that she did not proceed, and decided that whatever
she did she would do alone.</p>
<p>Fortune, obdurate hitherto, showed her unexpected favour.&nbsp; On
the Thursday before the Saturday fixed for the execution, Lodge remarked
to her that he was going away from home for another day or two on business
at a fair, and that he was sorry he could not take her with him.</p>
<p>She exhibited on this occasion so much readiness to stay at home
that he looked at her in surprise.&nbsp; Time had been when she would
have shown deep disappointment at the loss of such a jaunt.&nbsp; However,
he lapsed into his usual taciturnity, and on the day named left Holmstoke.</p>
<p>It was now her turn.&nbsp; She at first had thought of driving, but
on reflection held that driving would not do, since it would necessitate
her keeping to the turnpike-road, and so increase by tenfold the risk
of her ghastly errand being found out.&nbsp; She decided to ride, and
avoid the beaten track, notwithstanding that in her husband&rsquo;s
stables there was no animal just at present which by any stretch of
imagination could be considered a lady&rsquo;s mount, in spite of his
promise before marriage to always keep a mare for her.&nbsp; He had,
however, many cart-horses, fine ones of their kind; and among the rest
was a serviceable creature, an equine Amazon, with a back as broad as
a sofa, on which Gertrude had occasionally taken an airing when unwell.&nbsp;
This horse she chose.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon one of the men brought it round.&nbsp; She was
dressed, and before going down looked at her shrivelled arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
she said to it, &lsquo;if it had not been for you this terrible ordeal
would have been saved me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When strapping up the bundle in which she carried a few articles
of clothing, she took occasion to say to the servant, &lsquo;I take
these in case I should not get back to-night from the person I am going
to visit.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be alarmed if I am not in by ten, and close
up the house as usual.&nbsp; I shall be at home to-morrow for certain.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She meant then to privately tell her husband: the deed accomplished
was not like the deed projected.&nbsp; He would almost certainly forgive
her.</p>
<p>And then the pretty palpitating Gertrude Lodge went from her husband&rsquo;s
homestead; but though her goal was Casterbridge she did not take the
direct route thither through Stickleford.&nbsp; Her cunning course at
first was in precisely the opposite direction.&nbsp; As soon as she
was out of sight, however, she turned to the left, by a road which led
into Egdon, and on entering the heath wheeled round, and set out in
the true course, due westerly.&nbsp; A more private way down the county
could not be imagined; and as to direction, she had merely to keep her
horse&rsquo;s head to a point a little to the right of the sun.&nbsp;
She knew that she would light upon a furze-cutter or cottager of some
sort from time to time, from whom she might correct her bearing.</p>
<p>Though the date was comparatively recent, Egdon was much less fragmentary
in character than now.&nbsp; The attempts&mdash;successful and otherwise&mdash;at
cultivation on the lower slopes, which intrude and break up the original
heath into small detached heaths, had not been carried far; Enclosure
Acts had not taken effect, and the banks and fences which now exclude
the cattle of those villagers who formerly enjoyed rights of commonage
thereon, and the carts of those who had turbary privileges which kept
them in firing all the year round, were not erected.&nbsp; Gertrude,
therefore, rode along with no other obstacles than the prickly furze
bushes, the mats of heather, the white water-courses, and the natural
steeps and declivities of the ground.</p>
<p>Her horse was sure, if heavy-footed and slow, and though a draught
animal, was easy-paced; had it been otherwise, she was not a woman who
could have ventured to ride over such a bit of country with a half-dead
arm.&nbsp; It was therefore nearly eight o&rsquo;clock when she drew
rein to breathe the mare on the last outlying high point of heath-land
towards Casterbridge, previous to leaving Egdon for the cultivated valleys.</p>
<p>She halted before a pool called Rushy-pond, flanked by the ends of
two hedges; a railing ran through the centre of the pond, dividing it
in half.&nbsp; Over the railing she saw the low green country; over
the green trees the roofs of the town; over the roofs a white flat fa&ccedil;ade,
denoting the entrance to the county jail.&nbsp; On the roof of this
front specks were moving about; they seemed to be workmen erecting something.&nbsp;
Her flesh crept.&nbsp; She descended slowly, and was soon amid corn-fields
and pastures.&nbsp; In another half-hour, when it was almost dusk, Gertrude
reached the White Hart, the first inn of the town on that side.</p>
<p>Little surprise was excited by her arrival; farmers&rsquo; wives
rode on horseback then more than they do now; though, for that matter,
Mrs. Lodge was not imagined to be a wife at all; the innkeeper supposed
her some harum-skarum young woman who had come to attend &lsquo;hang-fair&rsquo;
next day.&nbsp; Neither her husband nor herself ever dealt in Casterbridge
market, so that she was unknown.&nbsp; While dismounting she beheld
a crowd of boys standing at the door of a harness-maker&rsquo;s shop
just above the inn, looking inside it with deep interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is going on there?&rsquo; she asked of the ostler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Making the rope for to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She throbbed responsively, and contracted her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis sold by the inch afterwards,&rsquo; the man continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I could get you a bit, miss, for nothing, if you&rsquo;d like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hastily repudiated any such wish, all the more from a curious
creeping feeling that the condemned wretch&rsquo;s destiny was becoming
interwoven with her own; and having engaged a room for the night, sat
down to think.</p>
<p>Up to this time she had formed but the vaguest notions about her
means of obtaining access to the prison.&nbsp; The words of the cunning-man
returned to her mind.&nbsp; He had implied that she should use her beauty,
impaired though it was, as a pass-key.&nbsp; In her inexperience she
knew little about jail functionaries; she had heard of a high-sheriff
and an under-sheriff; but dimly only.&nbsp; She knew, however, that
there must be a hangman, and to the hangman she determined to apply.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;A WATER-SIDE HERMIT</h3>
<p>At this date, and for several years after, there was a hangman to
almost every jail.&nbsp; Gertrude found, on inquiry, that the Casterbridge
official dwelt in a lonely cottage by a deep slow river flowing under
the cliff on which the prison buildings were situate&mdash;the stream
being the self-same one, though she did not know it, which watered the
Stickleford and Holmstoke meads lower down in its course.</p>
<p>Having changed her dress, and before she had eaten or drunk&mdash;for
she could not take her ease till she had ascertained some particulars&mdash;Gertrude
pursued her way by a path along the water-side to the cottage indicated.&nbsp;
Passing thus the outskirts of the jail, she discerned on the level roof
over the gateway three rectangular lines against the sky, where the
specks had been moving in her distant view; she recognized what the
erection was, and passed quickly on.&nbsp; Another hundred yards brought
her to the executioner&rsquo;s house, which a boy pointed out It stood
close to the same stream, and was hard by a weir, the waters of which
emitted a steady roar.</p>
<p>While she stood hesitating the door opened, and an old man came forth
shading a candle with one hand.&nbsp; Locking the door on the outside,
he turned to a flight of wooden steps fixed against the end of the cottage,
and began to ascend them, this being evidently the staircase to his
bedroom.&nbsp; Gertrude hastened forward, but by the time she reached
the foot of the ladder he was at the top.&nbsp; She called to him loudly
enough to be heard above the roar of the weir; he looked down and said,
&lsquo;What d&rsquo;ye want here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To speak to you a minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The candle-light, such as it was, fell upon her imploring, pale,
upturned face, and Davies (as the hangman was called) backed down the
ladder.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was just going to bed,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;&ldquo;Early
to bed and early to rise,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t mind stopping a minute
for such a one as you.&nbsp; Come into house.&rsquo;&nbsp; He reopened
the door, and preceded her to the room within.</p>
<p>The implements of his daily work, which was that of a jobbing gardener,
stood in a corner, and seeing probably that she looked rural, he said,
&lsquo;If you want me to undertake country work I can&rsquo;t come,
for I never leave Casterbridge for gentle nor simple&mdash;not I.&nbsp;
My real calling is officer of justice,&rsquo; he added formally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; To-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I thought so.&nbsp; Well, what&rsquo;s the matter
about that?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no use to come here about the knot&mdash;folks
do come continually, but I tell &rsquo;em one knot is as merciful as
another if ye keep it under the ear.&nbsp; Is the unfortunate man a
relation; or, I should say, perhaps&rsquo; (looking at her dress) &lsquo;a
person who&rsquo;s been in your employ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; What time is the execution?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same as usual&mdash;twelve o&rsquo;clock, or as soon after
as the London mail-coach gets in.&nbsp; We always wait for that, in
case of a reprieve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;a reprieve&mdash;I hope not!&rsquo; she said involuntarily,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&mdash;hee, hee!&mdash;as a matter of business, so do
I!&nbsp; But still, if ever a young fellow deserved to be let off, this
one does; only just turned eighteen, and only present by chance when
the rick was fired.&nbsp; Howsomever, there&rsquo;s not much risk of
it, as they are obliged to make an example of him, there having been
so much destruction of property that way lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; she explained, &lsquo;that I want to touch
him for a charm, a cure of an affliction, by the advice of a man who
has proved the virtue of the remedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, miss!&nbsp; Now I understand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had
such people come in past years.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t strike me
that you looked of a sort to require blood-turning.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the complaint?&nbsp; The wrong kind for this, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My arm.&rsquo;&nbsp; She reluctantly showed the withered skin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;&rsquo;tis all a-scram!&rsquo; said the hangman,
examining it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he continued, with interest, &lsquo;that <i>is</i>
the class o&rsquo; subject, I&rsquo;m bound to admit!&nbsp; I like the
look of the place; it is truly as suitable for the cure as any I ever
saw.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a knowing-man that sent &lsquo;ee, whoever he
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can contrive for me all that&rsquo;s necessary?&rsquo;
she said breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should really have gone to the governor of the jail, and
your doctor with &lsquo;ee, and given your name and address&mdash;that&rsquo;s
how it used to be done, if I recollect.&nbsp; Still, perhaps, I can
manage it for a trifling fee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, thank you!&nbsp; I would rather do it this way, as I should
like it kept private.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lover not to know, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha!&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get ee&rsquo; a touch
of the corpse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is it now?&rsquo; she said, shuddering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It?<i>&mdash;he</i>, you mean; he&rsquo;s living yet.&nbsp;
Just inside that little small winder up there in the glum.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He signified the jail on the cliff above.</p>
<p>She thought of her husband and her friends.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, of
course,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and how am I to proceed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took her to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, do you be waiting at the
little wicket in the wall, that you&rsquo;ll find up there in the lane,
not later than one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I will open it from the inside,
as I shan&rsquo;t come home to dinner till he&rsquo;s cut down.&nbsp;
Good-night.&nbsp; Be punctual; and if you don&rsquo;t want anybody to
know &lsquo;ee, wear a veil.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;once I had such a daughter
as you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went away, and climbed the path above, to assure herself that
she would be able to find the wicket next day.&nbsp; Its outline was
soon visible to her&mdash;a narrow opening in the outer wall of the
prison precincts.&nbsp; The steep was so great that, having reached
the wicket, she stopped a moment to breathe; and, looking back upon
the water-side cot, saw the hangman again ascending his outdoor staircase.&nbsp;
He entered the loft or chamber to which it led, and in a few minutes
extinguished his light.</p>
<p>The town clock struck ten, and she returned to the White Hart as
she had come.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;A RENCOUNTER</h3>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock on Saturday.&nbsp; Gertrude Lodge, having
been admitted to the jail as above described, was sitting in a waiting-room
within the second gate, which stood under a classic archway of ashlar,
then comparatively modern, and bearing the inscription, &lsquo;COVNTY
JAIL: 1793.&rsquo;&nbsp; This had been the fa&ccedil;ade she saw from
the heath the day before.&nbsp; Near at hand was a passage to the roof
on which the gallows stood.</p>
<p>The town was thronged, and the market suspended; but Gertrude had
seen scarcely a soul.&nbsp; Having kept her room till the hour of the
appointment, she had proceeded to the spot by a way which avoided the
open space below the cliff where the spectators had gathered; but she
could, even now, hear the multitudinous babble of their voices, out
of which rose at intervals the hoarse croak of a single voice uttering
the words, &lsquo;Last dying speech and confession!&rsquo;&nbsp; There
had been no reprieve, and the execution was over; but the crowd still
waited to see the body taken down.</p>
<p>Soon the persistent girl heard a trampling overhead, then a hand
beckoned to her, and, following directions, she went out and crossed
the inner paved court beyond the gatehouse, her knees trembling so that
she could scarcely walk.&nbsp; One of her arms was out of its sleeve,
and only covered by her shawl.</p>
<p>On the spot at which she had now arrived were two trestles, and before
she could think of their purpose she heard heavy feet descending stairs
somewhere at her back.&nbsp; Turn her head she would not, or could not,
and, rigid in this position, she was conscious of a rough coffin passing
her shoulder, borne by four men.&nbsp; It was open, and in it lay the
body of a young man, wearing the smockfrock of a rustic, and fustian
breeches.&nbsp; The corpse had been thrown into the coffin so hastily
that the skirt of the smockfrock was hanging over.&nbsp; The burden
was temporarily deposited on the trestles.</p>
<p>By this time the young woman&rsquo;s state was such that a gray mist
seemed to float before her eyes, on account of which, and the veil she
wore, she could scarcely discern anything: it was as though she had
nearly died, but was held up by a sort of galvanism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now!&rsquo; said a voice close at hand, and she was just conscious
that the word had been addressed to her.</p>
<p>By a last strenuous effort she advanced, at the same time hearing
persons approaching behind her.&nbsp; She bared her poor curst arm;
and Davies, uncovering the face of the corpse, took Gertrude&rsquo;s
hand, and held it so that her arm lay across the dead man&rsquo;s neck,
upon a line the colour of an unripe blackberry, which surrounded it.</p>
<p>Gertrude shrieked: &lsquo;the turn o&rsquo; the blood,&rsquo; predicted
by the conjuror, had taken place.&nbsp; But at that moment a second
shriek rent the air of the enclosure: it was not Gertrude&rsquo;s, and
its effect upon her was to make her start round.</p>
<p>Immediately behind her stood Rhoda Brook, her face drawn, and her
eyes red with weeping.&nbsp; Behind Rhoda stood Gertrude&rsquo;s own
husband; his countenance lined, his eyes dim, but without a tear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;D-n you! what are you doing here?&rsquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hussy&mdash;to come between us and our child now!&rsquo; cried
Rhoda.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the meaning of what Satan showed me in the
vision!&nbsp; You are like her at last!&rsquo;&nbsp; And clutching the
bare arm of the younger woman, she pulled her unresistingly back against
the wall.&nbsp; Immediately Brook had loosened her hold the fragile
young Gertrude slid down against the feet of her husband.&nbsp; When
he lifted her up she was unconscious.</p>
<p>The mere sight of the twain had been enough to suggest to her that
the dead young man was Rhoda&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; At that time the relatives
of an executed convict had the privilege of claiming the body for burial,
if they chose to do so; and it was for this purpose that Lodge was awaiting
the inquest with Rhoda.&nbsp; He had been summoned by her as soon as
the young man was taken in the crime, and at different times since;
and he had attended in court during the trial.&nbsp; This was the &lsquo;holiday&rsquo;
he had been indulging in of late.&nbsp; The two wretched parents had
wished to avoid exposure; and hence had come themselves for the body,
a waggon and sheet for its conveyance and covering being in waiting
outside.</p>
<p>Gertrude&rsquo;s case was so serious that it was deemed advisable
to call to her the surgeon who was at hand.&nbsp; She was taken out
of the jail into the town; but she never reached home alive.&nbsp; Her
delicate vitality, sapped perhaps by the paralyzed arm, collapsed under
the double shock that followed the severe strain, physical and mental,
to which she had subjected herself during the previous twenty-four hours.&nbsp;
Her blood had been &lsquo;turned&rsquo; indeed&mdash;too far.&nbsp;
Her death took place in the town three days after.</p>
<p>Her husband was never seen in Casterbridge again; once only in the
old market-place at Anglebury, which he had so much frequented, and
very seldom in public anywhere.&nbsp; Burdened at first with moodiness
and remorse, he eventually changed for the better, and appeared as a
chastened and thoughtful man.&nbsp; Soon after attending the funeral
of his poor young wife he took steps towards giving up the farms in
Holmstoke and the adjoining parish, and, having sold every head of his
stock, he went away to Port-Bredy, at the other end of the county, living
there in solitary lodgings till his death two years later of a painless
decline.&nbsp; It was then found that he had bequeathed the whole of
his not inconsiderable property to a reformatory for boys, subject to
the payment of a small annuity to Rhoda Brook, if she could be found
to claim it.</p>
<p>For some time she could not be found; but eventually she reappeared
in her old parish,&mdash;absolutely refusing, however, to have anything
to do with the provision made for her.&nbsp; Her monotonous milking
at the dairy was resumed, and followed for many long years, till her
form became bent, and her once abundant dark hair white and worn away
at the forehead&mdash;perhaps by long pressure against the cows.&nbsp;
Here, sometimes, those who knew her experiences would stand and observe
her, and wonder what sombre thoughts were beating inside that impassive,
wrinkled brow, to the rhythm of the alternating milk-streams.</p>

<h2>FELLOW-TOWNSMEN</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The shepherd on the east hill could shout out lambing intelligence
to the shepherd on the west hill, over the intervening town chimneys,
without great inconvenience to his voice, so nearly did the steep pastures
encroach upon the burghers&rsquo; backyards.&nbsp; And at night it was
possible to stand in the very midst of the town and hear from their
native paddocks on the lower levels of greensward the mild lowing of
the farmer&rsquo;s heifers, and the profound, warm blowings of breath
in which those creatures indulge.&nbsp; But the community which had
jammed itself in the valley thus flanked formed a veritable town, with
a real mayor and corporation, and a staple manufacture.</p>
<p>During a certain damp evening five-and-thirty years ago, before the
twilight was far advanced, a pedestrian of professional appearance,
carrying a small bag in his hand and an elevated umbrella, was descending
one of these hills by the turnpike road when he was overtaken by a phaeton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Downe&mdash;is that you?&rsquo; said the driver of
the vehicle, a young man of pale and refined appearance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jump
up here with me, and ride down to your door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other turned a plump, cheery, rather self-indulgent face over
his shoulder towards the hailer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, good evening, Mr. Barnet&mdash;thanks,&rsquo; he said,
and mounted beside his acquaintance.</p>
<p>They were fellow-burgesses of the town which lay beneath them, but
though old and very good friends, they were differently circumstanced.&nbsp;
Barnet was a richer man than the struggling young lawyer Downe, a fact
which was to some extent perceptible in Downe&rsquo;s manner towards
his companion, though nothing of it ever showed in Barnet&rsquo;s manner
towards the solicitor.&nbsp; Barnet&rsquo;s position in the town was
none of his own making; his father had been a very successful flax-merchant
in the same place, where the trade was still carried on as briskly as
the small capacities of its quarters would allow.&nbsp; Having acquired
a fair fortune, old Mr. Barnet had retired from business, bringing up
his son as a gentleman-burgher, and, it must be added, as a well-educated,
liberal-minded young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is Mrs. Barnet?&rsquo; asked Downe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Barnet was very well when I left home,&rsquo; the other
answered constrainedly, exchanging his meditative regard of the horse
for one of self-consciousness.</p>
<p>Mr. Downe seemed to regret his inquiry, and immediately took up another
thread of conversation.&nbsp; He congratulated his friend on his election
as a council-man; he thought he had not seen him since that event took
place; Mrs. Downe had meant to call and congratulate Mrs. Barnet, but
he feared that she had failed to do so as yet.</p>
<p>Barnet seemed hampered in his replies.&nbsp; <i>&lsquo;We</i> should
have been glad to see you.&nbsp; I&mdash;my wife would welcome Mrs.
Downe at any time, as you know . . . Yes, I am a member of the corporation&mdash;rather
an inexperienced member, some of them say.&nbsp; It is quite true; and
I should have declined the honour as premature&mdash;having other things
on my hands just now, too&mdash;if it had not been pressed upon me so
very heartily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is one thing you have on your hands which I can never
quite see the necessity for,&rsquo; said Downe, with good-humoured freedom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What the deuce do you want to build that new mansion for, when
you have already got such an excellent house as the one you live in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet&rsquo;s face acquired a warmer shade of colour; but as the
question had been idly asked by the solicitor while regarding the surrounding
flocks and fields, he answered after a moment with no apparent embarrassment
-</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we wanted to get out of the town, you know: the house
I am living in is rather old and inconvenient.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Downe
declared that he had chosen a pretty site for the new building.&nbsp;
They would be able to see for miles and miles from the windows.&nbsp;
Was he going to give it a name?&nbsp; He supposed so.</p>
<p>Barnet thought not.&nbsp; There was no other house near that was
likely to be mistaken for it.&nbsp; And he did not care for a name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I think it has a name!&rsquo;&nbsp; Downe observed: &lsquo;I
went past&mdash;when was it?&mdash;this morning; and I saw something,&mdash;&ldquo;Ch&acirc;teau
Ringdale,&rdquo; I think it was, stuck up on a board!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was an idea she&mdash;we had for a short time,&rsquo; said
Barnet hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we have decided finally to do without
a name&mdash;at any rate such a name as that.&nbsp; It must have been
a week ago that you saw it.&nbsp; It was taken down last Saturday .
. . Upon that matter I am firm!&rsquo; he added grimly.</p>
<p>Downe murmured in an unconvinced tone that he thought he had seen
it yesterday.</p>
<p>Talking thus they drove into the town.&nbsp; The street was unusually
still for the hour of seven in the evening; an increasing drizzle had
prevailed since the afternoon, and now formed a gauze across the yellow
lamps, and trickled with a gentle rattle down the heavy roofs of stone
tile, that bent the house-ridges hollow-backed with its weight, and
in some instances caused the walls to bulge outwards in the upper story.&nbsp;
Their route took them past the little town-hall, the Black-Bull Hotel,
and onward to the junction of a small street on the right, consisting
of a row of those two-and-two windowed brick residences of no particular
age, which are exactly alike wherever found, except in the people they
contain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drive you up to your door,&rsquo; said
Barnet, when Downe prepared to alight at the corner.&nbsp; He thereupon
turned into the narrow street, when the faces of three little girls
could be discerned close to the panes of a lighted window a few yards
ahead, surmounted by that of a young matron, the gaze of all four being
directed eagerly up the empty street.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a fortunate
fellow, Downe,&rsquo; Barnet continued, as mother and children disappeared
from the window to run to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must be happy if
any man is.&nbsp; I would give a hundred such houses as my new one to
have a home like yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;yes, we get along pretty comfortably,&rsquo; replied
Downe complacently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That house, Downe, is none of my ordering,&rsquo; Barnet broke
out, revealing a bitterness hitherto suppressed, and checking the horse
a moment to finish his speech before delivering up his passenger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The house I have already is good enough for me, as you supposed.&nbsp;
It is my own freehold; it was built by my grandfather, and is stout
enough for a castle.&nbsp; My father was born there, lived there, and
died there.&nbsp; I was born there, and have always lived there; yet
I must needs build a new one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you?&rsquo; said Downe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do I?&nbsp; To preserve peace in the household.&nbsp;
I do anything for that; but I don&rsquo;t succeed.&nbsp; I was firm
in resisting &ldquo;Ch&acirc;teau Ringdale,&rdquo; however; not that
I would not have put up with the absurdity of the name, but it was too
much to have your house christened after Lord Ringdale, because your
wife once had a fancy for him.&nbsp; If you only knew everything, you
would think all attempt at reconciliation hopeless.&nbsp; In your happy
home you have had no such experiences; and God forbid that you ever
should.&nbsp; See, here they are all ready to receive you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course!&nbsp; And so will your wife be waiting to receive
you,&rsquo; said Downe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take my word for it she will!&nbsp;
And with a dinner prepared for you far better than mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; Barnet replied dubiously.</p>
<p>He moved on to Downe&rsquo;s door, which the solicitor&rsquo;s family
had already opened.&nbsp; Downe descended, but being encumbered with
his bag and umbrella, his foot slipped, and he fell upon his knees in
the gutter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my dear Charles!&rsquo; said his wife, running down the
steps; and, quite ignoring the presence of Barnet, she seized hold of
her husband, pulled him to his feet, and kissed him, exclaiming, &lsquo;I
hope you are not hurt, darling!&rsquo;&nbsp; The children crowded round,
chiming in piteously, &lsquo;Poor papa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Barnet, perceiving that
Downe was only a little muddy, and looking more at the wife than at
the husband.&nbsp; Almost at any other time&mdash;certainly during his
fastidious bachelor years&mdash;he would have thought her a too demonstrative
woman; but those recent circumstances of his own life to which he had
just alluded made Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s solicitude so affecting that his
eye grew damp as he witnessed it.&nbsp; Bidding the lawyer and his family
good-night he left them, and drove slowly into the main street towards
his own house.</p>
<p>The heart of Barnet was sufficiently impressionable to be influenced
by Downe&rsquo;s parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome
home as he imagined: the dreary night might, at least on this one occasion,
make Downe&rsquo;s forecast true.&nbsp; Hence it was in a suspense that
he could hardly have believed possible that he halted at his door.&nbsp;
On entering his wife was nowhere to be seen, and he inquired for her.&nbsp;
The servant informed him that her mistress had the dressmaker with her,
and would be engaged for some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dressmaker at this time of day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She dined early, sir, and hopes you will excuse her joining
you this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she knew I was coming to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go up and tell her I am come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The servant did so; but the mistress of the house merely transmitted
her former words.</p>
<p>Barnet said nothing more, and presently sat down to his lonely meal,
which was eaten abstractedly, the domestic scene he had lately witnessed
still impressing him by its contrast with the situation here.&nbsp;
His mind fell back into past years upon a certain pleasing and gentle
being whose face would loom out of their shades at such times as these.&nbsp;
Barnet turned in his chair, and looked with unfocused eyes in a direction
southward from where he sat, as if he saw not the room but a long way
beyond.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder if she lives there still!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>He rose with a sudden rebelliousness, put on his hat and coat, and
went out of the house, pursuing his way along the glistening pavement
while eight o&rsquo;clock was striking from St. Mary&rsquo;s tower,
and the apprentices and shopmen were slamming up the shutters from end
to end of the town.&nbsp; In two minutes only those shops which could
boast of no attendant save the master or the mistress remained with
open eyes.&nbsp; These were ever somewhat less prompt to exclude customers
than the others: for their owners&rsquo; ears the closing hour had scarcely
the cheerfulness that it possessed for the hired servants of the rest.&nbsp;
Yet the night being dreary the delay was not for long, and their windows,
too, blinked together one by one.</p>
<p>During this time Barnet had proceeded with decided step in a direction
at right angles to the broad main thoroughfare of the town, by a long
street leading due southward.&nbsp; Here, though his family had no more
to do with the flax manufacture, his own name occasionally greeted him
on gates and warehouses, being used allusively by small rising tradesmen
as a recommendation, in such words as &lsquo;Smith, from Barnet &amp;
Co.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Robinson, late manager at Barnet&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The sight led him to reflect upon his father&rsquo;s busy life, and
he questioned if it had not been far happier than his own.</p>
<p>The houses along the road became fewer, and presently open ground
appeared between them on either side, the track on the right hand rising
to a higher level till it merged in a knoll.&nbsp; On the summit a row
of builders&rsquo; scaffold-poles probed the indistinct sky like spears,
and at their bases could be discerned the lower courses of a building
lately begun.&nbsp; Barnet slackened his pace and stood for a few moments
without leaving the centre of the road, apparently not much interested
in the sight, till suddenly his eye was caught by a post in the fore
part of the ground bearing a white board at the top.&nbsp; He went to
the rails, vaulted over, and walked in far enough to discern painted
upon the board &lsquo;Ch&acirc;teau Ringdale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A dismal irony seemed to lie in the words, and its effect was to
irritate him.&nbsp; Downe, then, had spoken truly.&nbsp; He stuck his
umbrella into the sod, and seized the post with both hands, as if intending
to loosen and throw it down.&nbsp; Then, like one bewildered by an opposition
which would exist none the less though its manifestations were removed,
he allowed his arms to sink to his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be,&rsquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
declared there shall be peace&mdash;if possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taking up his umbrella he quietly left the enclosure, and went on
his way, still keeping his back to the town.&nbsp; He had advanced with
more decision since passing the new building, and soon a hoarse murmur
rose upon the gloom; it was the sound of the sea.&nbsp; The road led
to the harbour, at a distance of a mile from the town, from which the
trade of the district was fed.&nbsp; After seeing the obnoxious name-board
Barnet had forgotten to open his umbrella, and the rain tapped smartly
on his hat, and occasionally stroked his face as he went on.</p>
<p>Though the lamps were still continued at the roadside, they stood
at wider intervals than before, and the pavement had given place to
common road.&nbsp; Every time he came to a lamp an increasing shine
made itself visible upon his shoulders, till at last they quite glistened
with wet.&nbsp; The murmur from the shore grew stronger, but it was
still some distance off when he paused before one of the smallest of
the detached houses by the wayside, standing in its own garden, the
latter being divided from the road by a row of wooden palings.&nbsp;
Scrutinizing the spot to ensure that he was not mistaken, he opened
the gate and gently knocked at the cottage door.</p>
<p>When he had patiently waited minutes enough to lead any man in ordinary
cases to knock again, the door was heard to open, though it was impossible
to see by whose hand, there being no light in the passage.&nbsp; Barnet
said at random, &lsquo;Does Miss Savile live here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A youthful voice assured him that she did live there, and by a sudden
afterthought asked him to come in.&nbsp; It would soon get a light,
it said: but the night being wet, mother had not thought it worth while
to trim the passage lamp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to get a light for me,&rsquo;
said Barnet hastily; &lsquo;it is not necessary at all.&nbsp; Which
is Miss Savile&rsquo;s sitting-room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young person, whose white pinafore could just be discerned, signified
a door in the side of the passage, and Barnet went forward at the same
moment, so that no light should fall upon his face.&nbsp; On entering
the room he closed the door behind him, pausing till he heard the retreating
footsteps of the child.</p>
<p>He found himself in an apartment which was simply and neatly, though
not poorly furnished; everything, from the miniature chiffonnier to
the shining little daguerreotype which formed the central ornament of
the mantelpiece, being in scrupulous order.&nbsp; The picture was enclosed
by a frame of embroidered card-board&mdash;evidently the work of feminine
hands&mdash;and it was the portrait of a thin faced, elderly lieutenant
in the navy.&nbsp; From behind the lamp on the table a female form now
rose into view, that of a young girl, and a resemblance between her
and the portrait was early discoverable.&nbsp; She had been so absorbed
in some occupation on the other side of the lamp as to have barely found
time to realize her visitor&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>They both remained standing for a few seconds without speaking.&nbsp;
The face that confronted Barnet had a beautiful outline; the Raffaelesque
oval of its contour was remarkable for an English countenance, and that
countenance housed in a remote country-road to an unheard-of harbour.&nbsp;
But her features did not do justice to this splendid beginning: Nature
had recollected that she was not in Italy; and the young lady&rsquo;s
lineaments, though not so inconsistent as to make her plain, would have
been accepted rather as pleasing than as correct.&nbsp; The preoccupied
expression which, like images on the retina, remained with her for a
moment after the state that caused it had ceased, now changed into a
reserved, half-proud, and slightly indignant look, in which the blood
diffused itself quickly across her cheek, and additional brightness
broke the shade of her rather heavy eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I have no business here,&rsquo; he said, answering
the look.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I had a great wish to see you, and inquire
how you were.&nbsp; You can give your hand to me, seeing how often I
have held it in past days?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather forget than remember all that, Mr. Barnet,&rsquo;
she answered, as she coldly complied with the request.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
I think of the circumstances of our last meeting, I can hardly consider
it kind of you to allude to such a thing as our past&mdash;or, indeed,
to come here at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no harm in it surely?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trouble
you often, Lucy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not had the honour of a visit from you for a very long
time, certainly, and I did not expect it now,&rsquo; she said, with
the same stiffness in her air.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope Mrs. Barnet is very
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; he impatiently returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
least I suppose so&mdash;though I only speak from inference!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she is your wife, sir,&rsquo; said the young girl tremulously.</p>
<p>The unwonted tones of a man&rsquo;s voice in that feminine chamber
had startled a canary that was roosting in its cage by the window; the
bird awoke hastily, and fluttered against the bars.&nbsp; She went and
stilled it by laying her face against the cage and murmuring a coaxing
sound.&nbsp; It might partly have been done to still herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to talk of Mrs. Barnet,&rsquo; he pursued;
&lsquo;I came to talk of you, of yourself alone; to inquire how you
are getting on since your great loss.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he turned towards
the portrait of her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am getting on fairly well, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The force of her utterance was scarcely borne out by her look; but
Barnet courteously reproached himself for not having guessed a thing
so natural; and to dissipate all embarrassment, added, as he bent over
the table, &lsquo;What were you doing when I came?&mdash;painting flowers,
and by candlelight?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not painting them&mdash;only
sketching the outlines.&nbsp; I do that at night to save time&mdash;I
have to get three dozen done by the end of the month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet looked as if he regretted it deeply.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will
wear your poor eyes out,&rsquo; he said, with more sentiment than he
had hitherto shown.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought not to do it.&nbsp; There
was a time when I should have said you must not.&nbsp; Well&mdash;I
almost wish I had never seen light with my own eyes when I think of
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this a time or place for recalling such matters?&rsquo;
she asked, with dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;You used to have a gentlemanly
respect for me, and for yourself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t speak any more as
you have spoken, and don&rsquo;t come again.&nbsp; I cannot think that
this visit is serious, or was closely considered by you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Considered: well, I came to see you as an old and good friend&mdash;not
to mince matters, to visit a woman I loved.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be angry!&nbsp;
I could not help doing it, so many things brought you into my mind .
. . This evening I fell in with an acquaintance, and when I saw how
happy he was with his wife and family welcoming him home, though with
only one-tenth of my income and chances, and thought what might have
been in my case, it fairly broke down my discretion, and off I came
here.&nbsp; Now I am here I feel that I am wrong to some extent.&nbsp;
But the feeling that I should like to see you, and talk of those we
used to know in common, was very strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before that can be the case a little more time must pass,&rsquo;
said Miss Savile quietly; &lsquo;a time long enough for me to regard
with some calmness what at present I remember far too impatiently&mdash;though
it may be you almost forget it.&nbsp; Indeed you must have forgotten
it long before you acted as you did.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her voice grew stronger
and more vivacious as she added: &lsquo;But I am doing my best to forget
it too, and I know I shall succeed from the progress I have made already!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had remained standing till now, when she turned and sat down,
facing half away from him.</p>
<p>Barnet watched her moodily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it is only what I deserve,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ambition pricked me on&mdash;no, it was not ambition,
it was wrongheadedness!&nbsp; Had I but reflected . . . &rsquo;&nbsp;
He broke out vehemently: &lsquo;But always remember this, Lucy: if you
had written to me only one little line after that misunderstanding,
I declare I should have come back to you.&nbsp; That ruined me!&rsquo;
he slowly walked as far as the little room would allow him to go, and
remained with his eyes on the skirting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Barnet, how could I write to you?&nbsp; There was
no opening for my doing so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there ought to have been,&rsquo; said Barnet, turning.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That was my fault!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that; but as there
had been nothing said by me which required any explanation by letter,
I did not send one.&nbsp; Everything was so indefinite, and feeling
your position to be so much wealthier than mine, I fancied I might have
mistaken your meaning.&nbsp; And when I heard of the other lady&mdash;a
woman of whose family even you might be proud&mdash;I thought how foolish
I had been, and said nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I suppose it was destiny&mdash;accident&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know what, that separated us, dear Lucy.&nbsp; Anyhow you were the woman
I ought to have made my wife&mdash;and I let you slip, like the foolish
man that I was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Mr. Barnet,&rsquo; she said, almost in tears, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
revive the subject to me; I am the wrong one to console you&mdash;think,
sir,&mdash;you should not be here&mdash;it would be so bad for me if
it were known!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would&mdash;it would, indeed,&rsquo; he said hastily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am not right in doing this, and I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a very common folly of human nature, you know, to think
the course you did <i>not</i> adopt must have been the best,&rsquo;
she continued, with gentle solicitude, as she followed him to the door
of the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t know that I should have
accepted you, even if you had asked me to be your wife.&rsquo;&nbsp;
At this his eye met hers, and she dropped her gaze.&nbsp; She knew that
her voice belied her.&nbsp; There was a silence till she looked up to
add, in a voice of soothing playfulness, &lsquo;My family was so much
poorer than yours, even before I lost my dear father, that&mdash;perhaps
your companions would have made it unpleasant for us on account of my
deficiencies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your disposition would soon have won them round,&rsquo; said
Barnet.</p>
<p>She archly expostulated: &lsquo;Now, never mind my disposition; try
to make it up with your wife!&nbsp; Those are my commands to you.&nbsp;
And now you are to leave me at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will.&nbsp; I must make the best of it all, I suppose,&rsquo;
he replied, more cheerfully than he had as yet spoken.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I shall never again meet with such a dear girl as you!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he suddenly opened the door, and left her alone.&nbsp; When his
glance again fell on the lamps that were sparsely ranged along the dreary
level road, his eyes were in a state which showed straw-like motes of
light radiating from each flame into the surrounding air.</p>
<p>On the other side of the way Barnet observed a man under an umbrella,
walking parallel with himself.&nbsp; Presently this man left the footway,
and gradually converged on Barnet&rsquo;s course.&nbsp; The latter then
saw that it was Charlson, a surgeon of the town, who owed him money.&nbsp;
Charlson was a man not without ability; yet he did not prosper.&nbsp;
Sundry circumstances stood in his way as a medical practitioner: he
was needy; he was not a coddle; he gossiped with men instead of with
women; he had married a stranger instead of one of the town young ladies;
and he was given to conversational buffoonery.&nbsp; Moreover, his look
was quite erroneous.&nbsp; Those only proper features in the family
doctor, the quiet eye, and the thin straight passionless lips which
never curl in public either for laughter or for scorn, were not his;
he had a full-curved mouth, and a bold black eye that made timid people
nervous.&nbsp; His companions were what in old times would have been
called boon companions&mdash;an expression which, though of irreproachable
root, suggests fraternization carried to the point of unscrupulousness.&nbsp;
All this was against him in the little town of his adoption.</p>
<p>Charlson had been in difficulties, and to oblige him Barnet had put
his name to a bill; and, as he had expected, was called upon to meet
it when it fell due.&nbsp; It had been only a matter of fifty pounds,
which Barnet could well afford to lose, and he bore no ill-will to the
thriftless surgeon on account of it.&nbsp; But Charlson had a little
too much brazen indifferentism in his composition to be altogether a
desirable acquaintance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope to be able to make that little bill-business right
with you in the course of three weeks, Mr. Barnet,&rsquo; said Charlson
with hail-fellow friendliness.</p>
<p>Barnet replied good-naturedly that there was no hurry.</p>
<p>This particular three weeks had moved on in advance of Charlson&rsquo;s
present with the precision of a shadow for some considerable time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a dream,&rsquo; Charlson continued.&nbsp; Barnet
knew from his tone that the surgeon was going to begin his characteristic
nonsense, and did not encourage him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a dream,&rsquo;
repeated Charlson, who required no encouragement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dreamed
that a gentleman, who has been very kind to me, married a haughty lady
in haste, before he had quite forgotten a nice little girl he knew before,
and that one wet evening, like the present, as I was walking up the
harbour-road, I saw him come out of that dear little girl&rsquo;s present
abode.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet glanced towards the speaker.&nbsp; The rays from a neighbouring
lamp struck through the drizzle under Charlson&rsquo;s umbrella, so
as just to illumine his face against the shade behind, and show that
his eye was turned up under the outer corner of its lid, whence it leered
with impish jocoseness as he thrust his tongue into his cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Barnet gravely, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have
no more of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;of course not,&rsquo; Charlson hastily answered,
seeing that his humour had carried him too far, as it had done many
times before.&nbsp; He was profuse in his apologies, but Barnet did
not reply.&nbsp; Of one thing he was certain&mdash;that scandal was
a plant of quick root, and that he was bound to obey Lucy&rsquo;s injunction
for Lucy&rsquo;s own sake.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>He did so, to the letter; and though, as the crocus followed the
snowdrop and the daffodil the crocus in Lucy&rsquo;s garden, the harbour-road
was a not unpleasant place to walk in, Barnet&rsquo;s feet never trod
its stones, much less approached her door.&nbsp; He avoided a saunter
that way as he would have avoided a dangerous dram, and took his airings
a long distance northward, among severely square and brown ploughed
fields, where no other townsman came.&nbsp; Sometimes he went round
by the lower lanes of the borough, where the rope-walks stretched in
which his family formerly had share, and looked at the rope-makers walking
backwards, overhung by apple-trees and bushes, and intruded on by cows
and calves, as if trade had established itself there at considerable
inconvenience to Nature.</p>
<p>One morning, when the sun was so warm as to raise a steam from the
south-eastern slopes of those flanking hills that looked so lovely above
the old roofs, but made every low-chimneyed house in the town as smoky
as Tophet, Barnet glanced from the windows of the town-council room
for lack of interest in what was proceeding within.&nbsp; Several members
of the corporation were present, but there was not much business doing,
and in a few minutes Downe came leisurely across to him, saying that
he seldom saw Barnet now.</p>
<p>Barnet owned that he was not often present.</p>
<p>Downe looked at the crimson curtain which hung down beside the panes,
reflecting its hot hues into their faces, and then out of the window.&nbsp;
At that moment there passed along the street a tall commanding lady,
in whom the solicitor recognized Barnet&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Barnet had
done the same thing, and turned away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be all right some day,&rsquo; said Downe, with cheering
sympathy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard, then, of her last outbreak?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Downe depressed his cheerfulness to its very reverse in a moment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, I have not heard of anything serious,&rsquo; he said, with
as long a face as one naturally round could be turned into at short
notice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only hear vague reports of such things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may think it will be all right,&rsquo; said Barnet drily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I have a different opinion . . . No, Downe, we must look
the thing in the face.&nbsp; Not poppy nor mandragora&mdash;however,
how are your wife and children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Downe said that they were all well, thanks; they were out that morning
somewhere; he was just looking to see if they were walking that way.&nbsp;
Ah, there they were, just coming down the street; and Downe pointed
to the figures of two children with a nursemaid, and a lady walking
behind them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will come out and speak to her?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not this morning.&nbsp; The fact is I don&rsquo;t care to
speak to anybody just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are too sensitive, Mr. Barnet.&nbsp; At school I remember
you used to get as red as a rose if anybody uttered a word that hurt
your feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet mused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he admitted, &lsquo;there
is a grain of truth in that.&nbsp; It is because of that I often try
to make peace at home.&nbsp; Life would be tolerable then at any rate,
even if not particularly bright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought more than once of proposing a little plan to
you,&rsquo; said Downe with some hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether it will meet your views, but take it or leave it, as you
choose.&nbsp; In fact, it was my wife who suggested it: that she would
be very glad to call on Mrs. Barnet and get into her confidence.&nbsp;
She seems to think that Mrs. Barnet is rather alone in the town, and
without advisers.&nbsp; Her impression is that your wife will listen
to reason.&nbsp; Emily has a wonderful way of winning the hearts of
people of her own sex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of the other sex too, I think.&nbsp; She is a charming
woman, and you were a lucky fellow to find her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps I was,&rsquo; simpered Downe, trying to wear
an aspect of being the last man in the world to feel pride.&nbsp; &lsquo;However,
she will be likely to find out what ruffles Mrs. Barnet.&nbsp; Perhaps
it is some misunderstanding, you know&mdash;something that she is too
proud to ask you to explain, or some little thing in your conduct that
irritates her because she does not fully comprehend you.&nbsp; The truth
is, Emily would have been more ready to make advances if she had been
quite sure of her fitness for Mrs. Barnet&rsquo;s society, who has of
course been accustomed to London people of good position, which made
Emily fearful of intruding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet expressed his warmest thanks for the well-intentioned proposition.&nbsp;
There was reason in Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s fear&mdash;that he owned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But do let her call,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no
woman in England I would so soon trust on such an errand.&nbsp; I am
afraid there will not be any brilliant result; still I shall take it
as the kindest and nicest thing if she will try it, and not be frightened
at a repulse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Barnet and Downe had parted, the former went to the Town Savings-Bank,
of which he was a trustee, and endeavoured to forget his troubles in
the contemplation of low sums of money, and figures in a network of
red and blue lines.&nbsp; He sat and watched the working-people making
their deposits, to which at intervals he signed his name.&nbsp; Before
he left in the afternoon Downe put his head inside the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily has seen Mrs. Barnet,&rsquo; he said, in a low voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She has got Mrs. Barnet&rsquo;s promise to take her for a drive
down to the shore to-morrow, if it is fine.&nbsp; Good afternoon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet shook Downe by the hand without speaking, and Downe went away.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>The next day was as fine as the arrangement could possibly require.&nbsp;
As the sun passed the meridian and declined westward, the tall shadows
from the scaffold-poles of Barnet&rsquo;s rising residence streaked
the ground as far as to the middle of the highway.&nbsp; Barnet himself
was there inspecting the progress of the works for the first time during
several weeks.&nbsp; A building in an old-fashioned town five-and-thirty
years ago did not, as in the modern fashion, rise from the sod like
a booth at a fair.&nbsp; The foundations and lower courses were put
in and allowed to settle for many weeks before the superstructure was
built up, and a whole summer of drying was hardly sufficient to do justice
to the important issues involved.&nbsp; Barnet stood within a window-niche
which had as yet received no frame, and thence looked down a slope into
the road.&nbsp; The wheels of a chaise were heard, and then his handsome
Xantippe, in the company of Mrs. Downe, drove past on their way to the
shore.&nbsp; They were driving slowly; there was a pleasing light in
Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s face, which seemed faintly to reflect itself upon
the countenance of her companion&mdash;that <i>politesse du coeur</i>
which was so natural to her having possibly begun already to work results.&nbsp;
But whatever the situation, Barnet resolved not to interfere, or do
anything to hazard the promise of the day.&nbsp; He might well afford
to trust the issue to another when he could never direct it but to ill
himself.&nbsp; His wife&rsquo;s clenched rein-hand in its lemon-coloured
glove, her stiff erect figure, clad in velvet and lace, and her boldly-outlined
face, passed on, exhibiting their owner as one fixed for ever above
the level of her companion&mdash;socially by her early breeding, and
materially by her higher cushion.</p>
<p>Barnet decided to allow them a proper time to themselves, and then
stroll down to the shore and drive them home.&nbsp; After lingering
on at the house for another hour he started with this intention.&nbsp;
A few hundred yards below &lsquo;Ch&acirc;teau Ringdale&rsquo; stood
the cottage in which the late lieutenant&rsquo;s daughter had her lodging.&nbsp;
Barnet had not been so far that way for a long time, and as he approached
the forbidden ground a curious warmth passed into him, which led him
to perceive that, unless he were careful, he might have to fight the
battle with himself about Lucy over again.&nbsp; A tenth of his present
excuse would, however, have justified him in travelling by that road
to-day.</p>
<p>He came opposite the dwelling, and turned his eyes for a momentary
glance into the little garden that stretched from the palings to the
door.&nbsp; Lucy was in the enclosure; she was walking and stooping
to gather some flowers, possibly for the purpose of painting them, for
she moved about quickly, as if anxious to save time.&nbsp; She did not
see him; he might have passed unnoticed; but a sensation which was not
in strict unison with his previous sentiments that day led him to pause
in his walk and watch her.&nbsp; She went nimbly round and round the
beds of anemones, tulips, jonquils, polyanthuses, and other old-fashioned
flowers, looking a very charming figure in her half-mourning bonnet,
and with an incomplete nosegay in her left hand.&nbsp; Raising herself
to pull down a lilac blossom she observed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Barnet!&rsquo; she said, innocently smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
I have been thinking of you many times since Mrs. Barnet went by in
the pony-carriage, and now here you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Lucy,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then she seemed to recall particulars of their last meeting, and
he believed that she flushed, though it might have been only the fancy
of his own supersensitivenesss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to the harbour,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you?&rsquo; Lucy remarked simply.&nbsp; &lsquo;A great
many people begin to go there now the summer is drawing on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face had come more into his view as she spoke, and he noticed
how much thinner and paler it was than when he had seen it last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lucy, how weary you look! tell me, can I help you?&rsquo; he
was going to cry out.&mdash;&lsquo;If I do,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;it
will be the ruin of us both!&rsquo;&nbsp; He merely said that the afternoon
was fine, and went on his way.</p>
<p>As he went a sudden blast of air came over the hill as if in contradiction
to his words, and spoilt the previous quiet of the scene.&nbsp; The
wind had already shifted violently, and now smelt of the sea.</p>
<p>The harbour-road soon began to justify its name.&nbsp; A gap appeared
in the rampart of hills which shut out the sea, and on the left of the
opening rose a vertical cliff, coloured a burning orange by the sunlight,
the companion cliff on the right being livid in shade.&nbsp; Between
these cliffs, like the Libyan bay which sheltered the shipwrecked Trojans,
was a little haven, seemingly a beginning made by Nature herself of
a perfect harbour, which appealed to the passer-by as only requiring
a little human industry to finish it and make it famous, the ground
on each side as far back as the daisied slopes that bounded the interior
valley being a mere layer of blown sand.&nbsp; But the Port-Bredy burgesses
a mile inland had, in the course of ten centuries, responded many times
to that mute appeal, with the result that the tides had invariably choked
up their works with sand and shingle as soon as completed.&nbsp; There
were but few houses here: a rough pier, a few boats, some stores, an
inn, a residence or two, a ketch unloading in the harbour, were the
chief features of the settlement.&nbsp; On the open ground by the shore
stood his wife&rsquo;s pony-carriage, empty, the boy in attendance holding
the horse.</p>
<p>When Barnet drew nearer, he saw an indigo-coloured spot moving swiftly
along beneath the radiant base of the eastern cliff, which proved to
be a man in a jersey, running with all his might.&nbsp; He held up his
hand to Barnet, as it seemed, and they approached each other.&nbsp;
The man was local, but a stranger to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it, my man?&rsquo; said Barnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A terrible calamity!&rsquo; the boatman hastily explained.&nbsp;
Two ladies had been capsized in a boat&mdash;they were Mrs. Downe and
Mrs. Barnet of the old town; they had driven down there that afternoon&mdash;they
had alighted, and it was so fine, that, after walking about a little
while, they had been tempted to go out for a short sail round the cliff.&nbsp;
Just as they were putting in to the shore, the wind shifted with a sudden
gust, the boat listed over, and it was thought they were both drowned.&nbsp;
How it could have happened was beyond his mind to fathom, for John Green
knew how to sail a boat as well as any man there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is the way to the place?&rsquo; said Barnet.</p>
<p>It was just round the cliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Run to the carriage and tell the boy to bring it to the place
as soon as you can.&nbsp; Then go to the Harbour Inn and tell them to
ride to town for a doctor.&nbsp; Have they been got out of the water?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One lady has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Barnet.&nbsp; Mrs. Downe, it is feared, has fleeted out
to sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet ran on to that part of the shore which the cliff had hitherto
obscured from his view, and there discerned, a long way ahead, a group
of fishermen standing.&nbsp; As soon as he came up one or two recognized
him, and, not liking to meet his eye, turned aside with misgiving.&nbsp;
He went amidst them and saw a small sailing-boat lying draggled at the
water&rsquo;s edge; and, on the sloping shingle beside it, a soaked
and sandy woman&rsquo;s form in the velvet dress and yellow gloves of
his wife.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>All had been done that could be done.&nbsp; Mrs. Barnet was in her
own house under medical hands, but the result was still uncertain.&nbsp;
Barnet had acted as if devotion to his wife were the dominant passion
of his existence.&nbsp; There had been much to decide&mdash;whether
to attempt restoration of the apparently lifeless body as it lay on
the shore&mdash;whether to carry her to the Harbour Inn&mdash;whether
to drive with her at once to his own house.&nbsp; The first course,
with no skilled help or appliances near at hand, had seemed hopeless.&nbsp;
The second course would have occupied nearly as much time as a drive
to the town, owing to the intervening ridges of shingle, and the necessity
of crossing the harbour by boat to get to the house, added to which
much time must have elapsed before a doctor could have arrived down
there.&nbsp; By bringing her home in the carriage some precious moments
had slipped by; but she had been laid in her own bed in seven minutes,
a doctor called to her side, and every possible restorative brought
to bear upon her.</p>
<p>At what a tearing pace he had driven up that road, through the yellow
evening sunlight, the shadows flapping irksomely into his eyes as each
wayside object rushed past between him and the west!&nbsp; Tired workmen
with their baskets at their backs had turned on their homeward journey
to wonder at his speed.&nbsp; Halfway between the shore and Port-Bredy
town he had met Charlson, who had been the first surgeon to hear of
the accident.&nbsp; He was accompanied by his assistant in a gig.&nbsp;
Barnet had sent on the latter to the coast in case that Downe&rsquo;s
poor wife should by that time have been reclaimed from the waves, and
had brought Charlson back with him to the house.</p>
<p>Barnet&rsquo;s presence was not needed here, and he felt it to be
his next duty to set off at once and find Downe, that no other than
himself might break the news to him.</p>
<p>He was quite sure that no chance had been lost for Mrs. Downe by
his leaving the shore.&nbsp; By the time that Mrs. Barnet had been laid
in the carriage, a much larger group had assembled to lend assistance
in finding her friend, rendering his own help superfluous.&nbsp; But
the duty of breaking the news was made doubly painful by the circumstance
that the catastrophe which had befallen Mrs. Downe was solely the result
of her own and her husband&rsquo;s loving-kindness towards himself.</p>
<p>He found Downe in his office.&nbsp; When the solicitor comprehended
the intelligence he turned pale, stood up, and remained for a moment
perfectly still, as if bereft of his faculties; then his shoulders heaved,
he pulled out his handkerchief and began to cry like a child.&nbsp;
His sobs might have been heard in the next room.&nbsp; He seemed to
have no idea of going to the shore, or of doing anything; but when Barnet
took him gently by the hand and proposed to start at once, he quietly
acquiesced, neither uttering any further word nor making any effort
to repress his tears.</p>
<p>Barnet accompanied him to the shore, where, finding that no trace
had as yet been seen of Mrs. Downe, and that his stay would be of no
avail, he left Downe with his friends and the young doctor, and once
more hastened back to his own house.</p>
<p>At the door he met Charlson.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well!&rsquo;&nbsp; Barnet
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just come down,&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;we have
done everything, but without result.&nbsp; I sympathize with you in
your bereavement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet did not much appreciate Charlson&rsquo;s sympathy, which sounded
to his ears as something of a mockery from the lips of a man who knew
what Charlson knew about their domestic relations.&nbsp; Indeed there
seemed an odd spark in Charlson&rsquo;s full black eye as he said the
words; but that might have been imaginary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Mr. Barnet,&rsquo; Charlson resumed, &lsquo;that little
matter between us&mdash;I hope to settle it finally in three weeks at
least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that now,&rsquo; said Barnet abruptly.&nbsp; He
directed the surgeon to go to the harbour in case his services might
even now be necessary there: and himself entered the house.</p>
<p>The servants were coming from his wife&rsquo;s chamber, looking helplessly
at each other and at him.&nbsp; He passed them by and entered the room,
where he stood mutely regarding the bed for a few minutes, after which
he walked into his own dressing-room adjoining, and there paced up and
down.&nbsp; In a minute or two he noticed what a strange and total silence
had come over the upper part of the house; his own movements, muffled
as they were by the carpet, seemed noisy, and his thoughts to disturb
the air like articulate utterances.&nbsp; His eye glanced through the
window.&nbsp; Far down the road to the harbour a roof detained his gaze:
out of it rose a red chimney, and out of the red chimney a curl of smoke,
as from a fire newly kindled.&nbsp; He had often seen such a sight before.&nbsp;
In that house lived Lucy Savile; and the smoke was from the fire which
was regularly lighted at this time to make her tea.</p>
<p>After that he went back to the bedroom, and stood there some time
regarding his wife&rsquo;s silent form.&nbsp; She was a woman some years
older than himself, but had not by any means overpassed the maturity
of good looks and vigour.&nbsp; Her passionate features, well-defined,
firm, and statuesque in life, were doubly so now: her mouth and brow,
beneath her purplish black hair, showed only too clearly that the turbulency
of character which had made a bear-garden of his house had been no temporary
phase of her existence.&nbsp; While he reflected, he suddenly said to
himself, I wonder if all has been done?</p>
<p>The thought was led up to by his having fancied that his wife&rsquo;s
features lacked in its complete form the expression which he had been
accustomed to associate with the faces of those whose spirits have fled
for ever.&nbsp; The effacement of life was not so marked but that, entering
uninformed, he might have supposed her sleeping.&nbsp; Her complexion
was that seen in the numerous faded portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds;
it was pallid in comparison with life, but there was visible on a close
inspection the remnant of what had once been a flush; the keeping between
the cheeks and the hollows of the face being thus preserved, although
positive colour was gone.&nbsp; Long orange rays of evening sun stole
in through chinks in the blind, striking on the large mirror, and being
thence reflected upon the crimson hangings and woodwork of the heavy
bedstead, so that the general tone of light was remarkably warm; and
it was probable that something might be due to this circumstance.&nbsp;
Still the fact impressed him as strange.&nbsp; Charlson had been gone
more than a quarter of an hour: could it be possible that he had left
too soon, and that his attempts to restore her had operated so sluggishly
as only now to have made themselves felt?&nbsp; Barnet laid his hand
upon her chest, and fancied that ever and anon a faint flutter of palpitation,
gentle as that of a butterfly&rsquo;s wing, disturbed the stillness
there&mdash;ceasing for a time, then struggling to go on, then breaking
down in weakness and ceasing again.</p>
<p>Barnet&rsquo;s mother had been an active practitioner of the healing
art among her poorer neighbours, and her inspirations had all been derived
from an octavo volume of Domestic Medicine, which at this moment was
lying, as it had lain for many years, on a shelf in Barnet&rsquo;s dressing-room.&nbsp;
He hastily fetched it, and there read under the head &lsquo;Drowning:&rsquo;-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Exertions for the recovery of any person who has
not been immersed for a longer period than half-an-hour should be continued
for at least four hours, as there have been many cases in which returning
life has made itself visible even after a longer interval.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should, however, a weak action of any of the organs show itself
when the case seems almost hopeless, our efforts must be redoubled;
the feeble spark in this case requires to be solicited; it will certainly
disappear under a relaxation of labour.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barnet looked at his watch; it was now barely two hours and a half
from the time when he had first heard of the accident.&nbsp; He threw
aside the book and turned quickly to reach a stimulant which had previously
been used.&nbsp; Pulling up the blind for more light, his eye glanced
out of the window.&nbsp; There he saw that red chimney still smoking
cheerily, and that roof, and through the roof that somebody.&nbsp; His
mechanical movements stopped, his hand remained on the blind-cord, and
he seemed to become breathless, as if he had suddenly found himself
treading a high rope.</p>
<p>While he stood a sparrow lighted on the windowsill, saw him, and
flew away.&nbsp; Next a man and a dog walked over one of the green hills
which bulged above the roofs of the town.&nbsp; But Barnet took no notice.</p>
<p>We may wonder what were the exact images that passed through his
mind during those minutes of gazing upon Lucy Savile&rsquo;s house,
the sparrow, the man and the dog, and Lucy Savile&rsquo;s house again.&nbsp;
There are honest men who will not admit to their thoughts, even as idle
hypotheses, views of the future that assume as done a deed which they
would recoil from doing; and there are other honest men for whom morality
ends at the surface of their own heads, who will deliberate what the
first will not so much as suppose.&nbsp; Barnet had a wife whose pretence
distracted his home; she now lay as in death; by merely doing nothing&mdash;by
letting the intelligence which had gone forth to the world lie undisturbed&mdash;he
would effect such a deliverance for himself as he had never hoped for,
and open up an opportunity of which till now he had never dreamed.&nbsp;
Whether the conjuncture had arisen through any unscrupulous, ill-considered
impulse of Charlson to help out of a strait the friend who was so kind
as never to press him for what was due could not be told; there was
nothing to prove it; and it was a question which could never be asked.&nbsp;
The triangular situation&mdash;himself&mdash;his wife&mdash;Lucy Savile&mdash;was
the one clear thing.</p>
<p>From Barnet&rsquo;s actions we may infer that he <i>supposed</i>
such and such a result, for a moment, but did not deliberate.&nbsp;
He withdrew his hazel eyes from the scene without, calmly turned, rang
the bell for assistance, and vigorously exerted himself to learn if
life still lingered in that motionless frame.&nbsp; In a short time
another surgeon was in attendance; and then Barnet&rsquo;s surmise proved
to be true.&nbsp; The slow life timidly heaved again; but much care
and patience were needed to catch and retain it, and a considerable
period elapsed before it could be said with certainty that Mrs. Barnet
lived.&nbsp; When this was the case, and there was no further room for
doubt, Barnet left the chamber.&nbsp; The blue evening smoke from Lucy&rsquo;s
chimney had died down to an imperceptible stream, and as he walked about
downstairs he murmured to himself, &lsquo;My wife was dead, and she
is alive again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not so with Downe.&nbsp; After three hours&rsquo; immersion
his wife&rsquo;s body had been recovered, life, of course, being quite
extinct.&nbsp; Barnet on descending, went straight to his friend&rsquo;s
house, and there learned the result.&nbsp; Downe was helpless in his
wild grief, occasionally even hysterical.&nbsp; Barnet said little,
but finding that some guiding hand was necessary in the sorrow-stricken
household, took upon him to supervise and manage till Downe should be
in a state of mind to do so for himself.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>One September evening, four months later, when Mrs. Barnet was in
perfect health, and Mrs. Downe but a weakening memory, an errand-boy
paused to rest himself in front of Mr. Barnet&rsquo;s old house, depositing
his basket on one of the window-sills.&nbsp; The street was not yet
lighted, but there were lights in the house, and at intervals a flitting
shadow fell upon the blind at his elbow.&nbsp; Words also were audible
from the same apartment, and they seemed to be those of persons in violent
altercation.&nbsp; But the boy could not gather their purport, and he
went on his way.</p>
<p>Ten minutes afterwards the door of Barnet&rsquo;s house opened, and
a tall closely-veiled lady in a travelling-dress came out and descended
the freestone steps.&nbsp; The servant stood in the doorway watching
her as she went with a measured tread down the street.&nbsp; When she
had been out of sight for some minutes Barnet appeared at the door from
within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did your mistress leave word where she was going?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the carriage ordered to meet her anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she take a latch-key?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet went in again, sat down in his chair, and leaned back.&nbsp;
Then in solitude and silence he brooded over the bitter emotions that
filled his heart.&nbsp; It was for this that he had gratuitously restored
her to life, and made his union with another impossible!&nbsp; The evening
drew on, and nobody came to disturb him.&nbsp; At bedtime he told the
servants to retire, that he would sit up for Mrs. Barnet himself; and
when they were gone he leaned his head upon his hand and mused for hours.</p>
<p>The clock struck one, two; still his wife came not, and, with impatience
added to depression, he went from room to room till another weary hour
had passed.&nbsp; This was not altogether a new experience for Barnet;
but she had never before so prolonged her absence.&nbsp; At last he
sat down again and fell asleep.</p>
<p>He awoke at six o&rsquo;clock to find that she had not returned.&nbsp;
In searching about the rooms he discovered that she had taken a case
of jewels which had been hers before her marriage.&nbsp; At eight a
note was brought him; it was from his wife, in which she stated that
she had gone by the coach to the house of a distant relative near London,
and expressed a wish that certain boxes, articles of clothing, and so
on, might be sent to her forthwith.&nbsp; The note was brought to him
by a waiter at the Black-Bull Hotel, and had been written by Mrs. Barnet
immediately before she took her place in the stage.</p>
<p>By the evening this order was carried out, and Barnet, with a sense
of relief, walked out into the town.&nbsp; A fair had been held during
the day, and the large clear moon which rose over the most prominent
hill flung its light upon the booths and standings that still remained
in the street, mixing its rays curiously with those from the flaring
naphtha lamps.&nbsp; The town was full of country-people who had come
in to enjoy themselves, and on this account Barnet strolled through
the streets unobserved.&nbsp; With a certain recklessness he made for
the harbour-road, and presently found himself by the shore, where he
walked on till he came to the spot near which his friend the kindly
Mrs. Downe had lost her life, and his own wife&rsquo;s life had been
preserved.&nbsp; A tremulous pathway of bright moonshine now stretched
over the water which had engulfed them, and not a living soul was near.</p>
<p>Here he ruminated on their characters, and next on the young girl
in whom he now took a more sensitive interest than at the time when
he had been free to marry her.&nbsp; Nothing, so far as he was aware,
had ever appeared in his own conduct to show that such an interest existed.&nbsp;
He had made it a point of the utmost strictness to hinder that feeling
from influencing in the faintest degree his attitude towards his wife;
and this was made all the more easy for him by the small demand Mrs.
Barnet made upon his attentions, for which she ever evinced the greatest
contempt; thus unwittingly giving him the satisfaction of knowing that
their severance owed nothing to jealousy, or, indeed, to any personal
behaviour of his at all.&nbsp; Her concern was not with him or his feelings,
as she frequently told him; but that she had, in a moment of weakness,
thrown herself away upon a common burgher when she might have aimed
at, and possibly brought down, a peer of the realm.&nbsp; Her frequent
depreciation of Barnet in these terms had at times been so intense that
he was sorely tempted to retaliate on her egotism by owning that he
loved at the same low level on which he lived; but prudence had prevailed,
for which he was now thankful.</p>
<p>Something seemed to sound upon the shingle behind him over and above
the raking of the wave.&nbsp; He looked round, and a slight girlish
shape appeared quite close to him, He could not see her face because
it was in the direction of the moon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Barnet?&rsquo; the rambler said, in timid surprise.&nbsp;
The voice was the voice of Lucy Savile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Barnet.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can I repay you
for this pleasure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only came because the night was so clear.&nbsp; I am now
on my way home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad we have met.&nbsp; I want to know if you will let
me do something for you, to give me an occupation, as an idle man?&nbsp;
I am sure I ought to help you, for I know you are almost without friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should you tell me that?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the hope that you will be frank with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not altogether without friends here.&nbsp; But I am going
to make a little change in my life&mdash;to go out as a teacher of freehand
drawing and practical perspective, of course I mean on a comparatively
humble scale, because I have not been specially educated for that profession.&nbsp;
But I am sure I shall like it much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have an opening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not exactly got it, but I have advertised for one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, you must let me help you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not think it would compromise you, or that I am indifferent
to delicacy.&nbsp; I bear in mind how we stand.&nbsp; It is very unlikely
that you will succeed as teacher of the class you mention, so let me
do something of a different kind for you.&nbsp; Say what you would like,
and it shall be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; if I can&rsquo;t be a drawing-mistress or governess, or
something of that sort, I shall go to India and join my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could go abroad, anywhere, everywhere with you, Lucy,
and leave this place and its associations for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She played with the end of her bonnet-string, and hastily turned
aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ever touch upon that kind of topic again,&rsquo;
she said, with a quick severity not free from anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
simply makes it impossible for me to see you, much less receive any
guidance from you.&nbsp; No, thank you, Mr. Barnet; you can do nothing
for me at present; and as I suppose my uncertainty will end in my leaving
for India, I fear you never will.&nbsp; If ever I think you <i>can</i>
do anything, I will take the trouble to ask you.&nbsp; Till then, good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tone of her latter words was equivocal, and while he remained
in doubt whether a gentle irony was or was not inwrought with their
sound, she swept lightly round and left him alone.&nbsp; He saw her
form get smaller and smaller along the damp belt of sea-sand between
ebb and flood; and when she had vanished round the cliff into the harbour-road,
he himself followed in the same direction.</p>
<p>That her hopes from an advertisement should be the single thread
which held Lucy Savile in England was too much for Barnet.&nbsp; On
reaching the town he went straight to the residence of Downe, now a
widower with four children.&nbsp; The young motherless brood had been
sent to bed about a quarter of an hour earlier, and when Barnet entered
he found Downe sitting alone.&nbsp; It was the same room as that from
which the family had been looking out for Downe at the beginning of
the year, when Downe had slipped into the gutter and his wife had been
so enviably tender towards him.&nbsp; The old neatness had gone from
the house; articles lay in places which could show no reason for their
presence, as if momentarily deposited there some months ago, and forgotten
ever since; there were no flowers; things were jumbled together on the
furniture which should have been in cupboards; and the place in general
had that stagnant, unrenovated air which usually pervades the maimed
home of the widower.</p>
<p>Downe soon renewed his customary full-worded lament over his wife,
and even when he had worked himself up to tears, went on volubly, as
if a listener were a luxury to be enjoyed whenever he could be caught.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was a treasure beyond compare, Mr. Barnet!&nbsp; I shall
never see such another.&nbsp; Nobody now to nurse me&mdash;nobody to
console me in those daily troubles, you know, Barnet, which make consolation
so necessary to a nature like mine.&nbsp; It would be unbecoming to
repine, for her spirit&rsquo;s home was elsewhere&mdash;the tender light
in her eyes always showed it; but it is a long dreary time that I have
before me, and nobody else can ever fill the void left in my heart by
her loss&mdash;nobody&mdash;nobody!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Downe wiped his
eyes again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was a good woman in the highest sense,&rsquo; gravely
answered Barnet, who, though Downe&rsquo;s words drew genuine compassion
from his heart, could not help feeling that a tender reticence would
have been a finer tribute to Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s really sterling virtues
than such a second-class lament as this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have something to show you,&rsquo; Downe resumed, producing
from a drawer a sheet of paper on which was an elaborate design for
a canopied tomb.&nbsp; &lsquo;This has been sent me by the architect,
but it is not exactly what I want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have got Jones to do it, I see, the man who is carrying
out my house,&rsquo; said Barnet, as he glanced at the signature to
the drawing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but it is not quite what I want.&nbsp; I want something
more striking&mdash;more like a tomb I have seen in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral.&nbsp; Nothing less will do justice to my feelings, and how
far short of them that will fall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet privately thought the design a sufficiently imposing one as
it stood, even extravagantly ornate; but, feeling that he had no right
to criticize, he said gently, &lsquo;Downe, should you not live more
in your children&rsquo;s lives at the present time, and soften the sharpness
of regret for your own past by thinking of their future?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; but what can I do more?&rsquo; asked Downe, wrinkling
his forehead hopelessly.</p>
<p>It was with anxious slowness that Barnet produced his reply&mdash;the
secret object of his visit to-night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you not say one
day that you ought by rights to get a governess for the children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Downe admitted that he had said so, but that he could not see his
way to it.&nbsp; &lsquo;The kind of woman I should like to have,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;would be rather beyond my means.&nbsp; No; I think I
shall send them to school in the town when they are old enough to go
out alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I know of something better than that.&nbsp; The late
Lieutenant Savile&rsquo;s daughter, Lucy, wants to do something for
herself in the way of teaching.&nbsp; She would be inexpensive, and
would answer your purpose as well as anybody for six or twelve months.&nbsp;
She would probably come daily if you were to ask her, and so your housekeeping
arrangements would not be much affected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought she had gone away,&rsquo; said the solicitor, musing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where does she live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet told him, and added that, if Downe should think of her as
suitable, he would do well to call as soon as possible, or she might
be on the wing.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you do see her,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it
would be advisable not to mention my name.&nbsp; She is rather stiff
in her ideas of me, and it might prejudice her against a course if she
knew that I recommended it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Downe promised to give the subject his consideration, and nothing
more was said about it just then.&nbsp; But when Barnet rose to go,
which was not till nearly bedtime, he reminded Downe of the suggestion
and went up the street to his own solitary home with a sense of satisfaction
at his promising diplomacy in a charitable cause.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>The walls of his new house were carried up nearly to their full height.&nbsp;
By a curious though not infrequent reaction, Barnet&rsquo;s feelings
about that unnecessary structure had undergone a change; he took considerable
interest in its progress as a long-neglected thing, his wife before
her departure having grown quite weary of it as a hobby.&nbsp; Moreover,
it was an excellent distraction for a man in the unhappy position of
having to live in a provincial town with nothing to do.&nbsp; He was
probably the first of his line who had ever passed a day without toil,
and perhaps something like an inherited instinct disqualifies such men
for a life of pleasant inaction, such as lies in the power of those
whose leisure is not a personal accident, but a vast historical accretion
which has become part of their natures.</p>
<p>Thus Barnet got into a way of spending many of his leisure hours
on the site of the new building, and he might have been seen on most
days at this time trying the temper of the mortar by punching the joints
with his stick, looking at the grain of a floor-board, and meditating
where it grew, or picturing under what circumstances the last fire would
be kindled in the at present sootless chimneys.&nbsp; One day when thus
occupied he saw three children pass by in the company of a fair young
woman, whose sudden appearance caused him to flush perceptibly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, she is there,&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
a blessed thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Casting an interested glance over the rising building and the busy
workmen, Lucy Savile and the little Downes passed by; and after that
time it became a regular though almost unconscious custom of Barnet
to stand in the half-completed house and look from the ungarnished windows
at the governess as she tripped towards the sea-shore with her young
charges, which she was in the habit of doing on most fine afternoons.&nbsp;
It was on one of these occasions, when he had been loitering on the
first-floor landing, near the hole left for the staircase, not yet erected,
that there appeared above the edge of the floor a little hat, followed
by a little head.</p>
<p>Barnet withdrew through a doorway, and the child came to the top
of the ladder, stepping on to the floor and crying to her sisters and
Miss Savile to follow.&nbsp; Another head rose above the floor, and
another, and then Lucy herself came into view.&nbsp; The troop ran hither
and thither through the empty, shaving-strewn rooms, and Barnet came
forward.</p>
<p>Lucy uttered a small exclamation: she was very sorry that she had
intruded; she had not the least idea that Mr. Barnet was there: the
children had come up, and she had followed.</p>
<p>Barnet replied that he was only too glad to see them there.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And now, let me show you the rooms,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She passively assented, and he took her round.&nbsp; There was not
much to show in such a bare skeleton of a house, but he made the most
of it, and explained the different ornamental fittings that were soon
to be fixed here and there.&nbsp; Lucy made but few remarks in reply,
though she seemed pleased with her visit, and stole away down the ladder,
followed by her companions.</p>
<p>After this the new residence became yet more of a hobby for Barnet.&nbsp;
Downe&rsquo;s children did not forget their first visit, and when the
windows were glazed, and the handsome staircase spread its broad low
steps into the hall, they came again, prancing in unwearied succession
through every room from ground-floor to attics, while Lucy stood waiting
for them at the door.&nbsp; Barnet, who rarely missed a day in coming
to inspect progress, stepped out from the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not keep them out,&rsquo; she said, with an apologetic
blush.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tried to do so very much: but they are rather
wilful, and we are directed to walk this way for the sea air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do let them make the house their regular playground, and you
yours,&rsquo; said Barnet.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no better place for
children to romp and take their exercise in than an empty house, particularly
in muddy or damp weather such as we shall get a good deal of now; and
this place will not be furnished for a long long time&mdash;perhaps
never.&nbsp; I am not at all decided about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, but it must!&rsquo; replied Lucy, looking round at the
hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rooms are excellent, twice as high as ours; and
the views from the windows are so lovely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I daresay, I daresay,&rsquo; he said absently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will all the furniture be new?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the furniture be new&mdash;that&rsquo;s a thing I have
not thought of.&nbsp; In fact I only come here and look on.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s house would have been large enough for me, but another
person had a voice in the matter, and it was settled that we should
build.&nbsp; However, the place grows upon me; its recent associations
are cheerful, and I am getting to like it fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A certain uneasiness in Lucy&rsquo;s manner showed that the conversation
was taking too personal a turn for her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still, as modern
tastes develop, people require more room to gratify them in,&rsquo;
she said, withdrawing to call the children; and serenely bidding him
good afternoon she went on her way.</p>
<p>Barnet&rsquo;s life at this period was singularly lonely, and yet
he was happier than he could have expected.&nbsp; His wife&rsquo;s estrangement
and absence, which promised to be permanent, left him free as a boy
in his movements, and the solitary walks that he took gave him ample
opportunity for chastened reflection on what might have been his lot
if he had only shown wisdom enough to claim Lucy Savile when there was
no bar between their lives, and she was to be had for the asking.&nbsp;
He would occasionally call at the house of his friend Downe; but there
was scarcely enough in common between their two natures to make them
more than friends of that excellent sort whose personal knowledge of
each other&rsquo;s history and character is always in excess of intimacy,
whereby they are not so likely to be severed by a clash of sentiment
as in cases where intimacy springs up in excess of knowledge.&nbsp;
Lucy was never visible at these times, being either engaged in the school-room,
or in taking an airing out of doors; but, knowing that she was now comfortable,
and had given up the, to him, depressing idea of going off to the other
side of the globe, he was quite content.</p>
<p>The new house had so far progressed that the gardeners were beginning
to grass down the front.&nbsp; During an afternoon which he was passing
in marking the curve for the carriage-drive, he beheld her coming in
boldly towards him from the road.&nbsp; Hitherto Barnet had only caught
her on the premises by stealth; and this advance seemed to show that
at last her reserve had broken down.</p>
<p>A smile gained strength upon her face as she approached, and it was
quite radiant when she came up, and said, without a trace of embarrassment,
&lsquo;I find I owe you a hundred thanks&mdash;and it comes to me quite
as a surprise!&nbsp; It was through your kindness that I was engaged
by Mr. Downe.&nbsp; Believe me, Mr. Barnet, I did not know it until
yesterday, or I should have thanked you long and long ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had offended you&mdash;just a trifle&mdash;at the time,
I think?&rsquo; said Barnet, smiling, &lsquo;and it was best that you
should not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; she returned hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
allude to that; it is past and over, and we will let it be.&nbsp; The
house is finished almost, is it not?&nbsp; How beautiful it will look
when the evergreens are grown!&nbsp; Do you call the style Palladian,
Mr. Barnet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;really don&rsquo;t quite know what it is.&nbsp; Yes,
it must be Palladian, certainly.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll ask Jones, the
architect; for, to tell the truth, I had not thought much about the
style: I had nothing to do with choosing it, I am sorry to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She would not let him harp on this gloomy refrain, and talked on
bright matters till she said, producing a small roll of paper which
he had noticed in her hand all the while, &lsquo;Mr. Downe wished me
to bring you this revised drawing of the late Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s tomb,
which the architect has just sent him.&nbsp; He would like you to look
it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children came up with their hoops, and she went off with them
down the harbour-road as usual.&nbsp; Barnet had been glad to get those
words of thanks; he had been thinking for many months that he would
like her to know of his share in finding her a home such as it was;
and what he could not do for himself, Downe had now kindly done for
him.&nbsp; He returned to his desolate house with a lighter tread; though
in reason he hardly knew why his tread should be light.</p>
<p>On examining the drawing, Barnet found that, instead of the vast
altar-tomb and canopy Downe had determined on at their last meeting,
it was to be a more modest memorial even than had been suggested by
the architect; a coped tomb of good solid construction, with no useless
elaboration at all.&nbsp; Barnet was truly glad to see that Downe had
come to reason of his own accord; and he returned the drawing with a
note of approval.</p>
<p>He followed up the house-work as before, and as he walked up and
down the rooms, occasionally gazing from the windows over the bulging
green hills and the quiet harbour that lay between them, he murmured
words and fragments of words, which, if listened to, would have revealed
all the secrets of his existence.&nbsp; Whatever his reason in going
there, Lucy did not call again: the walk to the shore seemed to be abandoned:
he must have thought it as well for both that it should be so, for he
did not go anywhere out of his accustomed ways to endeavour to discover
her.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p>The winter and the spring had passed, and the house was complete.&nbsp;
It was a fine morning in the early part of June, and Barnet, though
not in the habit of rising early, had taken a long walk before breakfast;
returning by way of the new building.&nbsp; A sufficiently exciting
cause of his restlessness to-day might have been the intelligence which
had reached him the night before, that Lucy Savile was going to India
after all, and notwithstanding the representations of her friends that
such a journey was unadvisable in many ways for an unpractised girl,
unless some more definite advantage lay at the end of it than she could
show to be the case.&nbsp; Barnet&rsquo;s walk up the slope to the building
betrayed that he was in a dissatisfied mood.&nbsp; He hardly saw that
the dewy time of day lent an unusual freshness to the bushes and trees
which had so recently put on their summer habit of heavy leafage, and
made his newly-laid lawn look as well established as an old manorial
meadow.&nbsp; The house had been so adroitly placed between six tall
elms which were growing on the site beforehand, that they seemed like
real ancestral trees; and the rooks, young and old, cawed melodiously
to their visitor.</p>
<p>The door was not locked, and he entered.&nbsp; No workmen appeared
to be present, and he walked from sunny window to sunny window of the
empty rooms, with a sense of seclusion which might have been very pleasant
but for the antecedent knowledge that his almost paternal care of Lucy
Savile was to be thrown away by her wilfulness.&nbsp; Footsteps echoed
through an adjoining room; and bending his eyes in that direction, he
perceived Mr. Jones, the architect.&nbsp; He had come to look over the
building before giving the contractor his final certificate.&nbsp; They
walked over the house together.&nbsp; Everything was finished except
the papering: there were the latest improvements of the period in bell-hanging,
ventilating, smoke-jacks, fire-grates, and French windows.&nbsp; The
business was soon ended, and Jones, having directed Barnet&rsquo;s attention
to a roll of wall-paper patterns which lay on a bench for his choice,
was leaving to keep another engagement, when Barnet said, &lsquo;Is
the tomb finished yet for Mrs. Downe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;yes: it is at last,&rsquo; said the architect,
coming back and speaking as if he were in a mood to make a confidence.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have had no end of trouble in the matter, and, to tell the
truth, I am heartily glad it is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Barnet expressed his surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought poor Downe
had given up those extravagant notions of his? then he has gone back
to the altar and canopy after all?&nbsp; Well, he is to be excused,
poor fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;he has not at all gone back to them&mdash;quite
the reverse,&rsquo; Jones hastened to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has so reduced
design after design, that the whole thing has been nothing but waste
labour for me; till in the end it has become a common headstone, which
a mason put up in half a day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A common headstone?&rsquo; said Barnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I held out for some time for the addition of a
footstone at least.&nbsp; But he said, &ldquo;O no&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t
afford it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well&mdash;his family is growing up, poor fellow, and
his expenses are getting serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, exactly,&rsquo; said Jones, as if the subject were none
of his.&nbsp; And again directing Barnet&rsquo;s attention to the wall-papers,
the bustling architect left him to keep some other engagement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A common headstone,&rsquo; murmured Barnet, left again to
himself.&nbsp; He mused a minute or two, and next began looking over
and selecting from the patterns; but had not long been engaged in the
work when he heard another footstep on the gravel without, and somebody
enter the open porch.</p>
<p>Barnet went to the door&mdash;it was his manservant in search of
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been trying for some time to find you, sir,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;This letter has come by the post, and it is marked
immediate.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s this one from Mr. Downe, who called
just now wanting to see you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He searched his pocket for
the second.</p>
<p>Barnet took the first letter&mdash;it had a black border, and bore
the London postmark.&nbsp; It was not in his wife&rsquo;s handwriting,
or in that of any person he knew; but conjecture soon ceased as he read
the page, wherein he was briefly informed that Mrs. Barnet had died
suddenly on the previous day, at the furnished villa she had occupied
near London.</p>
<p>Barnet looked vaguely round the empty hall, at the blank walls, out
of the doorway.&nbsp; Drawing a long palpitating breath, and with eyes
downcast, he turned and climbed the stairs slowly, like a man who doubted
their stability.&nbsp; The fact of his wife having, as it were, died
once already, and lived on again, had entirely dislodged the possibility
of her actual death from his conjecture.&nbsp; He went to the landing,
leant over the balusters, and after a reverie, of whose duration he
had but the faintest notion, turned to the window and stretched his
gaze to the cottage further down the road, which was visible from his
landing, and from which Lucy still walked to the solicitor&rsquo;s house
by a cross path.&nbsp; The faint words that came from his moving lips
were simply, &lsquo;At last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, almost involuntarily, Barnet fell down on his knees and murmured
some incoherent words of thanksgiving.&nbsp; Surely his virtue in restoring
his wife to life had been rewarded!&nbsp; But, as if the impulse struck
uneasily on his conscience, he quickly rose, brushed the dust from his
trousers and set himself to think of his next movements.&nbsp; He could
not start for London for some hours; and as he had no preparations to
make that could not be made in half-an-hour, he mechanically descended
and resumed his occupation of turning over the wall-papers.&nbsp; They
had all got brighter for him, those papers.&nbsp; It was all changed&mdash;who
would sit in the rooms that they were to line?&nbsp; He went on to muse
upon Lucy&rsquo;s conduct in so frequently coming to the house with
the children; her occasional blush in speaking to him; her evident interest
in him.&nbsp; What woman can in the long run avoid being interested
in a man whom she knows to be devoted to her?&nbsp; If human solicitation
could ever effect anything, there should be no going to India for Lucy
now.&nbsp; All the papers previously chosen seemed wrong in their shades,
and he began from the beginning to choose again.</p>
<p>While entering on the task he heard a forced &lsquo;Ahem!&rsquo;
from without the porch, evidently uttered to attract his attention,
and footsteps again advancing to the door.&nbsp; His man, whom he had
quite forgotten in his mental turmoil, was still waiting there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; the man said from round the
doorway; &lsquo;but here&rsquo;s the note from Mr. Downe that you didn&rsquo;t
take.&nbsp; He called just after you went out, and as he couldn&rsquo;t
wait, he wrote this on your study-table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He handed in the letter&mdash;no black-bordered one now, but a practical-looking
note in the well-known writing of the solicitor.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR BARNET&rsquo;&mdash;it ran&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps
you will be prepared for the information I am about to give&mdash;that
Lucy Savile and myself are going to be married this morning.&nbsp; I
have hitherto said nothing as to my intention to any of my friends,
for reasons which I am sure you will fully appreciate.&nbsp; The crisis
has been brought about by her expressing her intention to join her brother
in India.&nbsp; I then discovered that I could not do without her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is to be quite a private wedding; but it is my particular
wish that you come down here quietly at ten, and go to church with us;
it will add greatly to the pleasure I shall experience in the ceremony,
and, I believe, to Lucy&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; I have called on you very
early to make the request, in the belief that I should find you at home;
but you are beforehand with me in your early rising.&mdash;Yours sincerely,
C. Downe.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Need I wait, sir?&rsquo; said the servant after a dead silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do, William.&nbsp; No answer,&rsquo; said Barnet
calmly.</p>
<p>When the man had gone Barnet re-read the letter.&nbsp; Turning eventually
to the wall-papers, which he had been at such pains to select, he deliberately
tore them into halves and quarters, and threw them into the empty fireplace.&nbsp;
Then he went out of the house; locked the door, and stood in the front
awhile.&nbsp; Instead of returning into the town, he went down the harbour-road
and thoughtfully lingered about by the sea, near the spot where the
body of Downe&rsquo;s late wife had been found and brought ashore.</p>
<p>Barnet was a man with a rich capacity for misery, and there is no
doubt that he exercised it to its fullest extent now.&nbsp; The events
that had, as it were, dashed themselves together into one half-hour
of this day showed that curious refinement of cruelty in their arrangement
which often proceeds from the bosom of the whimsical god at other times
known as blind Circumstance.&nbsp; That his few minutes of hope, between
the reading of the first and second letters, had carried him to extraordinary
heights of rapture was proved by the immensity of his suffering now.&nbsp;
The sun blazing into his face would have shown a close watcher that
a horizontal line, which he had never noticed before, but which was
never to be gone thereafter, was somehow gradually forming itself in
the smooth of his forehead.&nbsp; His eyes, of a light hazel, had a
curious look which can only be described by the word bruised; the sorrow
that looked from them being largely mixed with the surprise of a man
taken unawares.</p>
<p>The secondary particulars of his present position, too, were odd
enough, though for some time they appeared to engage little of his attention.&nbsp;
Not a soul in the town knew, as yet, of his wife&rsquo;s death; and
he almost owed Downe the kindness of not publishing it till the day
was over: the conjuncture, taken with that which had accompanied the
death of Mrs. Downe, being so singular as to be quite sufficient to
darken the pleasure of the impressionable solicitor to a cruel extent,
if made known to him.&nbsp; But as Barnet could not set out on his journey
to London, where his wife lay, for some hours (there being at this date
no railway within a distance of many miles), no great reason existed
why he should leave the town.</p>
<p>Impulse in all its forms characterized Barnet, and when he heard
the distant clock strike the hour of ten his feet began to carry him
up the harbour-road with the manner of a man who must do something to
bring himself to life.&nbsp; He passed Lucy Savile&rsquo;s old house,
his own new one, and came in view of the church.&nbsp; Now he gave a
perceptible start, and his mechanical condition went away.&nbsp; Before
the church-gate were a couple of carriages, and Barnet then could perceive
that the marriage between Downe and Lucy was at that moment being solemnized
within.&nbsp; A feeling of sudden, proud self-confidence, an indocile
wish to walk unmoved in spite of grim environments, plainly possessed
him, and when he reached the wicket-gate he turned in without apparent
effort.&nbsp; Pacing up the paved footway he entered the church and
stood for a while in the nave passage.&nbsp; A group of people was standing
round the vestry door; Barnet advanced through these and stepped into
the vestry.</p>
<p>There they were, busily signing their names.&nbsp; Seeing Downe about
to look round, Barnet averted his somewhat disturbed face for a second
or two; when he turned again front to front he was calm and quite smiling;
it was a creditable triumph over himself, and deserved to be remembered
in his native town.&nbsp; He greeted Downe heartily, offering his congratulations.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Barnet expected a half-guilty look upon Lucy&rsquo;s
face; but no, save the natural flush and flurry engendered by the service
just performed, there was nothing whatever in her bearing which showed
a disturbed mind: her gray-brown eyes carried in them now as at other
times the well-known expression of common-sensed rectitude which never
went so far as to touch on hardness.&nbsp; She shook hands with him,
and Downe said warmly, &lsquo;I wish you could have come sooner: I called
on purpose to ask you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll drive back with us now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Barnet; &lsquo;I am not at all prepared;
but I thought I would look in upon you for a moment, even though I had
not time to go home and dress.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stand back and see you
pass out, and observe the effect of the spectacle upon myself as one
of the public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Lucy and her husband laughed, and Barnet laughed and retired;
and the quiet little party went gliding down the nave and towards the
porch, Lucy&rsquo;s new silk dress sweeping with a smart rustle round
the base-mouldings of the ancient font, and Downe&rsquo;s little daughters
following in a state of round-eyed interest in their position, and that
of Lucy, their teacher and friend.</p>
<p>So Downe was comforted after his Emily&rsquo;s death, which had taken
place twelve months, two weeks, and three days before that time.</p>
<p>When the two flys had driven off and the spectators had vanished,
Barnet followed to the door, and went out into the sun.&nbsp; He took
no more trouble to preserve a spruce exterior; his step was unequal,
hesitating, almost convulsive; and the slight changes of colour which
went on in his face seemed refracted from some inward flame.&nbsp; In
the churchyard he became pale as a summer cloud, and finding it not
easy to proceed he sat down on one of the tombstones and supported his
head with his hand.</p>
<p>Hard by was a sexton filling up a grave which he had not found time
to finish on the previous evening.&nbsp; Observing Barnet, he went up
to him, and recognizing him, said, &lsquo;Shall I help you home, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, thank you,&rsquo; said Barnet, rousing himself and standing
up.&nbsp; The sexton returned to his grave, followed by Barnet, who,
after watching him awhile, stepped into the grave, now nearly filled,
and helped to tread in the earth.</p>
<p>The sexton apparently thought his conduct a little singular, but
he made no observation, and when the grave was full, Barnet suddenly
stopped, looked far away, and with a decided step proceeded to the gate
and vanished.&nbsp; The sexton rested on his shovel and looked after
him for a few moments, and then began banking up the mound.</p>
<p>In those short minutes of treading in the dead man Barnet had formed
a design, but what it was the inhabitants of that town did not for some
long time imagine.&nbsp; He went home, wrote several letters of business,
called on his lawyer, an old man of the same place who had been the
legal adviser of Barnet&rsquo;s father before him, and during the evening
overhauled a large quantity of letters and other documents in his possession.&nbsp;
By eleven o&rsquo;clock the heap of papers in and before Barnet&rsquo;s
grate had reached formidable dimensions, and he began to burn them.&nbsp;
This, owing to their quantity, it was not so easy to do as he had expected,
and he sat long into the night to complete the task.</p>
<p>The next morning Barnet departed for London, leaving a note for Downe
to inform him of Mrs. Barnet&rsquo;s sudden death, and that he was gone
to bury her; but when a thrice-sufficient time for that purpose had
elapsed, he was not seen again in his accustomed walks, or in his new
house, or in his old one.&nbsp; He was gone for good, nobody knew whither.&nbsp;
It was soon discovered that he had empowered his lawyer to dispose of
all his property, real and personal, in the borough, and pay in the
proceeds to the account of an unknown person at one of the large London
banks.&nbsp; The person was by some supposed to be himself under an
assumed name; but few, if any, had certain knowledge of that fact.</p>
<p>The elegant new residence was sold with the rest of his possessions;
and its purchaser was no other than Downe, now a thriving man in the
borough, and one whose growing family and new wife required more roomy
accommodation than was afforded by the little house up the narrow side
street.&nbsp; Barnet&rsquo;s old habitation was bought by the trustees
of the Congregational Baptist body in that town, who pulled down the
time-honoured dwelling and built a new chapel on its site.&nbsp; By
the time the last hour of that, to Barnet, eventful year had chimed,
every vestige of him had disappeared from the precincts of his native
place, and the name became extinct in the borough of Port-Bredy, after
having been a living force therein for more than two hundred years.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p>Twenty-one years and six months do not pass without setting a mark
even upon durable stone and triple brass; upon humanity such a period
works nothing less than transformation.&nbsp; In Barnet&rsquo;s old
birthplace vivacious young children with bones like india-rubber had
grown up to be stable men and women, men and women had dried in the
skin, stiffened, withered, and sunk into decrepitude; while selections
from every class had been consigned to the outlying cemetery.&nbsp;
Of inorganic differences the greatest was that a railway had invaded
the town, tying it on to a main line at a junction a dozen miles off.&nbsp;
Barnet&rsquo;s house on the harbour-road, once so insistently new, had
acquired a respectable mellowness, with ivy, Virginia creepers, lichens,
damp patches, and even constitutional infirmities of its own like its
elder fellows.&nbsp; Its architecture, once so very improved and modern,
had already become stale in style, without having reached the dignity
of being old-fashioned.&nbsp; Trees about the harbour-road had increased
in circumference or disappeared under the saw; while the church had
had such a tremendous practical joke played upon it by some facetious
restorer or other as to be scarce recognizable by its dearest old friends.</p>
<p>During this long interval George Barnet had never once been seen
or heard of in the town of his fathers.</p>
<p>It was the evening of a market-day, and some half-dozen middle-aged
farmers and dairymen were lounging round the bar of the Black-Bull Hotel,
occasionally dropping a remark to each other, and less frequently to
the two barmaids who stood within the pewter-topped counter in a perfunctory
attitude of attention, these latter sighing and making a private observation
to one another at odd intervals, on more interesting experiences than
the present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Days get shorter,&rsquo; said one of the dairymen, as he looked
towards the street, and noticed that the lamp-lighter was passing by.</p>
<p>The farmers merely acknowledged by their countenances the propriety
of this remark, and finding that nobody else spoke, one of the barmaids
said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; in a tone of painful duty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come fair-day we shall have to light up before we start for
home-along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; his neighbour conceded, with a gaze
of blankness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And after that we shan&rsquo;t see much further difference
all&rsquo;s winter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rest were not unwilling to go even so far as this.</p>
<p>The barmaid sighed again, and raised one of her hands from the counter
on which they rested to scratch the smallest surface of her face with
the smallest of her fingers.&nbsp; She looked towards the door, and
presently remarked, &lsquo;I think I hear the &lsquo;bus coming in from
station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the dairymen and farmers turned to the glass door dividing
the hall from the porch, and in a minute or two the omnibus drew up
outside.&nbsp; Then there was a lumbering down of luggage, and then
a man came into the hall, followed by a porter with a portmanteau on
his poll, which he deposited on a bench.</p>
<p>The stranger was an elderly person, with curly ashen white hair,
a deeply-creviced outer corner to each eyelid, and a countenance baked
by innumerable suns to the colour of terra-cotta, its hue and that of
his hair contrasting like heat and cold respectively.&nbsp; He walked
meditatively and gently, like one who was fearful of disturbing his
own mental equilibrium.&nbsp; But whatever lay at the bottom of his
breast had evidently made him so accustomed to its situation there that
it caused him little practical inconvenience.</p>
<p>He paused in silence while, with his dubious eyes fixed on the barmaids,
he seemed to consider himself.&nbsp; In a moment or two he addressed
them, and asked to be accommodated for the night.&nbsp; As he waited
he looked curiously round the hall, but said nothing.&nbsp; As soon
as invited he disappeared up the staircase, preceded by a chambermaid
and candle, and followed by a lad with his trunk.&nbsp; Not a soul had
recognized him.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, when the farmers and dairymen had driven
off to their homesteads in the country, he came downstairs, took a biscuit
and one glass of wine, and walked out into the town, where the radiance
from the shop-windows had grown so in volume of late years as to flood
with cheerfulness every standing cart, barrow, stall, and idler that
occupied the wayside, whether shabby or genteel.&nbsp; His chief interest
at present seemed to lie in the names painted over the shop-fronts and
on door-ways, as far as they were visible; these now differed to an
ominous extent from what they had been one-and-twenty years before.</p>
<p>The traveller passed on till he came to the bookseller&rsquo;s, where
he looked in through the glass door.&nbsp; A fresh-faced young man was
standing behind the counter, otherwise the shop was empty.&nbsp; The
gray-haired observer entered, asked for some periodical by way of paying
for admission, and with his elbow on the counter began to turn over
the pages he had bought, though that he read nothing was obvious.</p>
<p>At length he said, &lsquo;Is old Mr. Watkins still alive?&rsquo;
in a voice which had a curious youthful cadence in it even now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father is dead, sir,&rsquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I am sorry to hear it,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it is so many years since I last visited this town that I
could hardly expect it should be otherwise.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a short
silence he continued&mdash;&lsquo;And is the firm of Barnet, Browse,
and Company still in existence?<i>&mdash;</i>they used to be large flax-merchants
and twine-spinners here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The firm is still going on, sir, but they have dropped the
name of Barnet.&nbsp; I believe that was a sort of fancy name&mdash;at
least, I never knew of any living Barnet.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis now Browse
and Co.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And does Andrew Jones still keep on as architect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the Vicar of St. Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;Mr. Melrose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been dead a great many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused yet longer, and cleared his
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Mr. Downe, the solicitor, still in practice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; He died about seven years
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here it was a longer silence still; and an attentive observer would
have noticed that the paper in the stranger&rsquo;s hand increased its
imperceptible tremor to a visible shake.&nbsp; That gray-haired gentleman
noticed it himself, and rested the paper on the counter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
<i>Mrs</i>. Downe still alive?&rsquo; he asked, closing his lips firmly
as soon as the words were out of his mouth, and dropping his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, she&rsquo;s alive and well.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s living
at the old place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In East Street?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; at Ch&acirc;teau Ringdale.&nbsp; I believe it has been
in the family for some generations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She lives with her children, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; she has no children of her own.&nbsp; There were some
Miss Downes; I think they were Mr. Downe&rsquo;s daughters by a former
wife; but they are married and living in other parts of the town.&nbsp;
Mrs. Downe lives alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir; quite alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The newly-arrived gentleman went back to the hotel and dined; after
which he made some change in his dress, shaved back his beard to the
fashion that had prevailed twenty years earlier, when he was young and
interesting, and once more emerging, bent his steps in the direction
of the harbour-road.&nbsp; Just before getting to the point where the
pavement ceased and the houses isolated themselves, he overtook a shambling,
stooping, unshaven man, who at first sight appeared like a professional
tramp, his shoulders having a perceptible greasiness as they passed
under the gaslight.&nbsp; Each pedestrian momentarily turned and regarded
the other, and the tramp-like gentleman started back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good&mdash;why&mdash;is that Mr. Barnet?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
Mr. Barnet, surely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and you are Charlson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;ah&mdash;you notice my appearance.&nbsp; The Fates
have rather ill-used me.&nbsp; By-the-bye, that fifty pounds.&nbsp;
I never paid it, did I? . . . But I was not ungrateful!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Here the stooping man laid one hand emphatically on the palm of the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I gave you a chance, Mr. George Barnet, which many
men would have thought full value received&mdash;the chance to marry
your Lucy.&nbsp; As far as the world was concerned, your wife was a
<i>drowned woman</i>, hey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven forbid all that, Charlson!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, &rsquo;twas a wrong way of showing gratitude,
I suppose.&nbsp; And now a drop of something to drink for old acquaintance&rsquo;
sake!&nbsp; And Mr. Barnet, she&rsquo;s again free&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a chance now if you care for it&mdash;ha, ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the speaker
pushed his tongue into his hollow cheek and slanted his eye in the old
fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know all,&rsquo; said Barnet quickly; and slipping a small
present into the hands of the needy, saddening man, he stepped ahead
and was soon in the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>He reached the harbour-road, and paused before the entrance to a
well-known house.&nbsp; It was so highly bosomed in trees and shrubs
planted since the erection of the building that one would scarcely have
recognized the spot as that which had been a mere neglected slope till
chosen as a site for a dwelling.&nbsp; He opened the swing-gate, closed
it noiselessly, and gently moved into the semicircular drive, which
remained exactly as it had been marked out by Barnet on the morning
when Lucy Savile ran in to thank him for procuring her the post of governess
to Downe&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; But the growth of trees and bushes
which revealed itself at every step was beyond all expectation; sun-proof
and moon-proof bowers vaulted the walks, and the walls of the house
were uniformly bearded with creeping plants as high as the first-floor
windows.</p>
<p>After lingering for a few minutes in the dusk of the bending boughs,
the visitor rang the door-bell, and on the servant appearing, he announced
himself as &lsquo;an old friend of Mrs. Downe&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hall was lighted, but not brightly, the gas being turned low,
as if visitors were rare.&nbsp; There was a stagnation in the dwelling;
it seemed to be waiting.&nbsp; Could it really be waiting for him?&nbsp;
The partitions which had been probed by Barnet&rsquo;s walking-stick
when the mortar was green, were now quite brown with the antiquity of
their varnish, and the ornamental woodwork of the staircase, which had
glistened with a pale yellow newness when first erected, was now of
a rich wine-colour.&nbsp; During the servant&rsquo;s absence the following
colloquy could be dimly heard through the nearly closed door of the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t give his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He only said &ldquo;an old friend,&rdquo; ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of gentleman is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A staidish gentleman, with gray hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the second speaker seemed to affect the listener greatly.&nbsp;
After a pause, the lady said, &lsquo;Very well, I will see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the stranger was shown in face to face with the Lucy who had
once been Lucy Savile.&nbsp; The round cheek of that formerly young
lady had, of course, alarmingly flattened its curve in her modern representative;
a pervasive grayness overspread her once dark brown hair, like morning
rime on heather.&nbsp; The parting down the middle was wide and jagged;
once it had been a thin white line, a narrow crevice between two high
banks of shade.&nbsp; But there was still enough left to form a handsome
knob behind, and some curls beneath inwrought with a few hairs like
silver wires were very becoming.&nbsp; In her eyes the only modification
was that their originally mild rectitude of expression had become a
little more stringent than heretofore.&nbsp; Yet she was still girlish&mdash;a
girl who had been gratuitously weighted by destiny with a burden of
five-and-forty years instead of her proper twenty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; he said, when the servant
had closed the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you the instant I saw you!&rsquo; she returned cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but I always thought you would come back
to your old town again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand, and then they sat down.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
said you were dead,&rsquo; continued Lucy, &lsquo;but I never thought
so.&nbsp; We should have heard of it for certain if you had been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a very long time since we met.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; what you must have seen, Mr. Barnet, in all these roving
years, in comparison with what I have seen in this quiet place!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Her face grew more serious.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know my husband has been
dead a long time?&nbsp; I am a lonely old woman now, considering what
I have been; though Mr. Downe&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;all married&mdash;manage
to keep me pretty cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am a lonely old man, and have been any time these twenty
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where have you kept yourself?&nbsp; And why did you go
off so mysteriously?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Lucy, I have kept myself a little in America, and a
little in Australia, a little in India, a little at the Cape, and so
on; I have not stayed in any place for a long time, as it seems to me,
and yet more than twenty years have flown.&nbsp; But when people get
to my age two years go like one!&mdash;Your second question, why did
I go away so mysteriously, is surely not necessary.&nbsp; You guessed
why, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I never once guessed,&rsquo; she said simply; &lsquo;nor
did Charles, nor did anybody as far as I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, indeed!&nbsp; Now think it over again, and then look
at me, and say if you can&rsquo;t guess?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked him in the face with an inquiring smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely
not because of me?&rsquo; she said, pausing at the commencement of surprise.</p>
<p>Barnet nodded, and smiled again; but his smile was sadder than hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I married Charles?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; solely because you married him on the day I was free
to ask you to marry me.&nbsp; My wife died four-and-twenty hours before
you went to church with Downe.&nbsp; The fixing of my journey at that
particular moment was because of her funeral; but once away I knew I
should have no inducement to come back, and took my steps accordingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face assumed an aspect of gentle reflection, and she looked up
and down his form with great interest in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never
thought of it!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew, of course, that
you had once implied some warmth of feeling towards me, but I concluded
that it passed off.&nbsp; And I have always been under the impression
that your wife was alive at the time of my marriage.&nbsp; Was it not
stupid of me!&mdash;But you will have some tea or something?&nbsp; I
have never dined late, you know, since my husband&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
I have got into the way of making a regular meal of tea.&nbsp; You will
have some tea with me, will you not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The travelled man assented quite readily, and tea was brought in.&nbsp;
They sat and chatted over the meal, regardless of the flying hour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Barnet presently, as for the first time
he leisurely surveyed the room; &lsquo;how like it all is, and yet how
different!&nbsp; Just where your piano stands was a board on a couple
of trestles, bearing the patterns of wall-papers, when I was last here.&nbsp;
I was choosing them&mdash;standing in this way, as it might be.&nbsp;
Then my servant came in at the door, and handed me a note, so.&nbsp;
It was from Downe, and announced that you were just going to be married
to him.&nbsp; I chose no more wall-papers&mdash;tore up all those I
had selected, and left the house.&nbsp; I never entered it again till
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, at last I understand it all,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>They had both risen and gone to the fireplace.&nbsp; The mantel came
almost on a level with her shoulder, which gently rested against it,
and Barnet laid his hand upon the shelf close beside her shoulder.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lucy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;better late than never.&nbsp; Will
you marry me now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started back, and the surprise which was so obvious in her wrought
even greater surprise in him that it should be so.&nbsp; It was difficult
to believe that she had been quite blind to the situation, and yet all
reason and common sense went to prove that she was not acting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You take me quite unawares by such a question!&rsquo; she
said, with a forced laugh of uneasiness.&nbsp; It was the first time
she had shown any embarrassment at all.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; she
added, &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t marry you for the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not after all this!&nbsp; Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is&mdash;I would&mdash;I really think I may say it&mdash;I
would upon the whole rather marry you, Mr. Barnet, than any other man
I have ever met, if I ever dreamed of marriage again.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
dream of it&mdash;it is quite out of my thoughts; I have not the least
intention of marrying again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;on my account&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you alter your
plans a little?&nbsp; Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mr. Barnet,&rsquo; she said with a little flutter, &lsquo;I
would on your account if on anybody&rsquo;s in existence.&nbsp; But
you don&rsquo;t know in the least what it is you are asking&mdash;such
an impracticable thing&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say ridiculous, of course,
because I see that you are really in earnest, and earnestness is never
ridiculous to my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes,&rsquo; said Barnet more slowly, dropping her hand,
which he had taken at the moment of pleading, &lsquo;I am in earnest.&nbsp;
The resolve, two months ago, at the Cape, to come back once more was,
it is true, rather sudden, and as I see now, not well considered.&nbsp;
But I am in earnest in asking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I in declining.&nbsp; With all good feeling and all kindness,
let me say that I am quite opposed to the idea of marrying a second
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no harm has been done,&rsquo; he answered, with the
same subdued and tender humorousness that he had shown on such occasions
in early life.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you really won&rsquo;t accept me, I must
put up with it, I suppose.&rsquo;&nbsp; His eye fell on the clock as
he spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had you any notion that it was so late?&rsquo;
he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;How absorbed I have been!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She accompanied him to the hall, helped him to put on his overcoat,
and let him out of the house herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said Barnet, on the doorstep, as the lamp
shone in his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are not offended with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; Nor you with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll consider whether I am or not,&rsquo; he pleasantly
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She watched him safely through the gate; and when his footsteps had
died away upon the road, closed the door softly and returned to the
room.&nbsp; Here the modest widow long pondered his speeches, with eyes
dropped to an unusually low level.&nbsp; Barnet&rsquo;s urbanity under
the blow of her refusal greatly impressed her.&nbsp; After having his
long period of probation rendered useless by her decision, he had shown
no anger, and had philosophically taken her words as if he deserved
no better ones.&nbsp; It was very gentlemanly of him, certainly; it
was more than gentlemanly; it was heroic and grand.&nbsp; The more she
meditated, the more she questioned the virtue of her conduct in checking
him so peremptorily; and went to her bedroom in a mood of dissatisfaction.&nbsp;
On looking in the glass she was reminded that there was not so much
remaining of her former beauty as to make his frank declaration an impulsive
natural homage to her cheeks and eyes; it must undoubtedly have arisen
from an old staunch feeling of his, deserving tenderest consideration.&nbsp;
She recalled to her mind with much pleasure that he had told her he
was staying at the Black-Bull Hotel; so that if, after waiting a day
or two, he should not, in his modesty, call again, she might then send
him a nice little note.&nbsp; To alter her views for the present was
far from her intention; but she would allow herself to be induced to
reconsider the case, as any generous woman ought to do.</p>
<p>The morrow came and passed, and Mr. Barnet did not drop in.&nbsp;
At every knock, light youthful hues flew across her cheek; and she was
abstracted in the presence of her other visitors.&nbsp; In the evening
she walked about the house, not knowing what to do with herself; the
conditions of existence seemed totally different from those which ruled
only four-and-twenty short hours ago.&nbsp; What had been at first a
tantalizing elusive sentiment was getting acclimatized within her as
a definite hope, and her person was so informed by that emotion that
she might almost have stood as its emblematical representative by the
time the clock struck ten.&nbsp; In short, an interest in Barnet precisely
resembling that of her early youth led her present heart to belie her
yesterday&rsquo;s words to him, and she longed to see him again.</p>
<p>The next day she walked out early, thinking she might meet him in
the street.&nbsp; The growing beauty of her romance absorbed her, and
she went from the street to the fields, and from the fields to the shore,
without any consciousness of distance, till reminded by her weariness
that she could go no further.&nbsp; He had nowhere appeared.&nbsp; In
the evening she took a step which under the circumstances seemed justifiable;
she wrote a note to him at the hotel, inviting him to tea with her at
six precisely, and signing her note &lsquo;Lucy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour the messenger came back.&nbsp; Mr. Barnet
had left the hotel early in the morning of the day before, but he had
stated that he would probably return in the course of the week.</p>
<p>The note was sent back, to be given to him immediately on his arrival.</p>
<p>There was no sign from the inn that this desired event had occurred,
either on the next day or the day following.&nbsp; On both nights she
had been restless, and had scarcely slept half-an-hour.</p>
<p>On the Saturday, putting off all diffidence, Lucy went herself to
the Black-Bull, and questioned the staff closely.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnet had cursorily remarked when leaving that he might return
on the Thursday or Friday, but they were directed not to reserve a room
for him unless he should write.</p>
<p>He had left no address.</p>
<p>Lucy sorrowfully took back her note went home, and resolved to wait.</p>
<p>She did wait&mdash;years and years&mdash;but Barnet never reappeared.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 1880.</p>
<h2>INTERLOPERS AT THE KNAP</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The north road from Casterbridge is tedious and lonely, especially
in winter-time.&nbsp; Along a part of its course it connects with Long-Ash
Lane, a monotonous track without a village or hamlet for many miles,
and with very seldom a turning.&nbsp; Unapprized wayfarers who are too
old, or too young, or in other respects too weak for the distance to
be traversed, but who, nevertheless, have to walk it, say, as they look
wistfully ahead, &lsquo;Once at the top of that hill, and I must surely
see the end of Long-Ash Lane!&rsquo;&nbsp; But they reach the hilltop,
and Long-Ash Lane stretches in front as mercilessly as before.</p>
<p>Some few years ago a certain farmer was riding through this lane
in the gloom of a winter evening.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s friend, a
dairyman, was riding beside him.&nbsp; A few paces in the rear rode
the farmer&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; All three were well horsed on strong,
round-barrelled cobs; and to be well horsed was to be in better spirits
about Long-Ash Lane than poor pedestrians could attain to during its
passage.</p>
<p>But the farmer did not talk much to his friend as he rode along.&nbsp;
The enterprise which had brought him there filled his mind; for in truth
it was important.&nbsp; Not altogether so important was it, perhaps,
when estimated by its value to society at large; but if the true measure
of a deed be proportionate to the space it occupies in the heart of
him who undertakes it, Farmer Charles Darton&rsquo;s business to-night
could hold its own with the business of kings.</p>
<p>He was a large farmer.&nbsp; His turnover, as it is called, was probably
thirty thousand pounds a year.&nbsp; He had a great many draught horses,
a great many milch cows, and of sheep a multitude.&nbsp; This comfortable
position was, however, none of his own making.&nbsp; It had been created
by his father, a man of a very different stamp from the present representative
of the line.</p>
<p>Darton, the father, had been a one-idea&rsquo;d character, with a
buttoned-up pocket and a chink-like eye brimming with commercial subtlety.&nbsp;
In Darton the son, this trade subtlety had become transmuted into emotional,
and the harshness had disappeared; he would have been called a sad man
but for his constant care not to divide himself from lively friends
by piping notes out of harmony with theirs.&nbsp; Contemplative, he
allowed his mind to be a quiet meeting-place for memories and hopes.&nbsp;
So that, naturally enough, since succeeding to the agricultural calling,
and up to his present age of thirty-two, he had neither advanced nor
receded as a capitalist&mdash;a stationary result which did not agitate
one of his unambitious, unstrategic nature, since he had all that he
desired.&nbsp; The motive of his expedition to-night showed the same
absence of anxious regard for Number One.</p>
<p>The party rode on in the slow, safe trot proper to night-time and
bad roads, Farmer Darton&rsquo;s head jigging rather unromantically
up and down against the sky, and his motions being repeated with bolder
emphasis by his friend Japheth Johns; while those of the latter were
travestied in jerks still less softened by art in the person of the
lad who attended them.&nbsp; A pair of whitish objects hung one on each
side of the latter, bumping against him at each step, and still further
spoiling the grace of his seat.&nbsp; On close inspection they might
have been perceived to be open rush baskets&mdash;one containing a turkey,
and the other some bottles of wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;ye feel ye can meet your fate like a man, neighbour
Darton?&rsquo; asked Johns, breaking a silence which had lasted while
five-and-twenty hedgerow trees had glided by.</p>
<p>Mr. Darton with a half-laugh murmured, &lsquo;Ay&mdash;call it my
fate!&nbsp; Hanging and wiving go by destiny.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then
they were silent again.</p>
<p>The darkness thickened rapidly, at intervals shutting down on the
land in a perceptible flap, like the wave of a wing.&nbsp; The customary
close of day was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air.&nbsp;
With the fall of night had come a mist just damp enough to incommode,
but not sufficient to saturate them.&nbsp; Countrymen as they were&mdash;born,
as may be said, with only an open door between them and the four seasons&mdash;they
regarded the mist but as an added obscuration, and ignored its humid
quality.</p>
<p>They were travelling in a direction that was enlivened by no modern
current of traffic, the place of Darton&rsquo;s pilgrimage being an
old-fashioned village&mdash;one of the Hintocks (several villages of
that name, with a distinctive prefix or affix, lying thereabout)&mdash;where
the people make the best cider and cider-wine in all Wessex, and where
the dunghills smell of pomace instead of stable refuse as elsewhere.&nbsp;
The lane was sometimes so narrow that the brambles of the hedge, which
hung forward like anglers&rsquo; rods over a stream, scratched their
hats and curry-combed their whiskers as they passed.&nbsp; Yet this
neglected lane had been a highway to Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s subjects
and the cavalcades of the past.&nbsp; Its day was over now, and its
history as a national artery done for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why I have decided to marry her,&rsquo; resumed Darton (in
a measured musical voice of confidence which revealed a good deal of
his composition), as he glanced round to see that the lad was not too
near, &lsquo;is not only that I like her, but that I can do no better,
even from a fairly practical point of view.&nbsp; That I might ha&rsquo;
looked higher is possibly true, though it is really all nonsense.&nbsp;
I have had experience enough in looking above me.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more
superior women for me,&rdquo; said I&mdash;you know when.&nbsp; Sally
is a comely, independent, simple character, with no make-up about her,
who&rsquo;ll think me as much a superior to her as I used to think&mdash;you
know who I mean&mdash;was to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Johns.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, I shouldn&rsquo;t
call Sally Hall simple.&nbsp; Primary, because no Sally is; secondary,
because if some could be, this one wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
a wrong denomination to apply to a woman, Charles, and affects me, as
your best man, like cold water.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like recommending a
stage play by saying there&rsquo;s neither murder, villainy, nor harm
of any sort in it, when that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve paid your half-crown
to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; may your opinion do you good.&nbsp; Mine&rsquo;s a different
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; And turning the conversation from the philosophical
to the practical, Darton expressed a hope that the said Sally had received
what he&rsquo;d sent on by the carrier that day.</p>
<p>Johns wanted to know what that was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a dress,&rsquo; said Darton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not exactly
a wedding-dress; though she may use it as one if she likes.&nbsp; It
is rather serviceable than showy&mdash;suitable for the winter weather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said Johns.&nbsp; &lsquo;Serviceable is a wise
word in a bridegroom.&nbsp; I commend ye, Charles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For,&rsquo; said Darton, &lsquo;why should a woman dress up
like a rope-dancer because she&rsquo;s going to do the most solemn deed
of her life except dying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, why?&nbsp; But she will, because she will, I suppose,&rsquo;
said Dairyman Johns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; said Darton.</p>
<p>The lane they followed had been nearly straight for several miles,
but it now took a turn, and winding uncertainly for some distance forked
into two.&nbsp; By night country roads are apt to reveal ungainly qualities
which pass without observation during day; and though Darton had travelled
this way before, he had not done so frequently, Sally having been wooed
at the house of a relative near his own.&nbsp; He never remembered seeing
at this spot a pair of alternative ways looking so equally probable
as these two did now.&nbsp; Johns rode on a few steps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be out of heart, sonny,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a handpost.&nbsp; Enoch&mdash;come and climm this
post, and tell us the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lad dismounted, and jumped into the hedge where the post stood
under a tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unstrap the baskets, or you&rsquo;ll smash up that wine!&rsquo;
cried Darton, as the young man began spasmodically to climb the post,
baskets and all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there ever less head in a brainless world?&rsquo; said
Johns.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, simple Nocky, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He leapt off, and with much puffing climbed the post, striking a match
when he reached the top, and moving the light along the arm, the lad
standing and gazing at the spectacle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have faced tantalization these twenty years with a temper
as mild as milk!&rsquo; said Japheth; &lsquo;but such things as this
don&rsquo;t come short of devilry!&rsquo;&nbsp; And flinging the match
away, he slipped down to the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked Darton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a letter, sacred or heathen&mdash;not so much as would
tell us the way to the great fireplace&mdash;ever I should sin to say
it!&nbsp; Either the moss and mildew have eat away the words, or we
have arrived in a land where the natyves have lost the art o&rsquo;
writing, and should ha&rsquo; brought our compass like Christopher Columbus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us take the straightest road,&rsquo; said Darton placidly;
&lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t be sorry to get there&mdash;&rsquo;tis a tiresome
ride.&nbsp; I would have driven if I had known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I neither, sir,&rsquo; said Enoch.&nbsp; &lsquo;These
straps plough my shoulder like a zull.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis much further
to your lady&rsquo;s home, Maister Darton, I shall ask to be let carry
half of these good things in my innerds&mdash;hee, hee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you be such a reforming radical, Enoch,&rsquo;
said Johns sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take the turkey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This being done, they went forward by the right-hand lane, which
ascended a hill, the left winding away under a plantation.&nbsp; The
pit-a-pat of their horses&rsquo; hoofs lessened up the slope; and the
ironical directing-post stood in solitude as before, holding out its
blank arms to the raw breeze, which brought a snore from the wood as
if Skrymir the Giant were sleeping there.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Three miles to the left of the travellers, along the road they had
not followed, rose an old house with mullioned windows of Ham-hill stone,
and chimneys of lavish solidity.&nbsp; It stood at the top of a slope
beside King&rsquo;s-Hintock village-street; and immediately in front
of it grew a large sycamore-tree, whose bared roots formed a convenient
staircase from the road below to the front door of the dwelling.&nbsp;
Its situation gave the house what little distinctive name it possessed,
namely, &lsquo;The Knap.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some forty yards off a brook dribbled
past, which, for its size, made a great deal of noise.&nbsp; At the
back was a dairy barton, accessible for vehicles and live-stock by a
side &lsquo;drong.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus much only of the character of the
homestead could be divined out of doors at this shady evening-time.</p>
<p>But within there was plenty of light to see by, as plenty was construed
at Hintock.&nbsp; Beside a Tudor fireplace, whose moulded four-centred
arch was nearly hidden by a figured blue-cloth blower, were seated two
women&mdash;mother and daughter&mdash;Mrs. Hall, and Sarah, or Sally;
for this was a part of the world where the latter modification had not
as yet been effaced as a vulgarity by the march of intellect.&nbsp;
The owner of the name was the young woman by whose means Mr. Darton
proposed to put an end to his bachelor condition on the approaching
day.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s bereavement had been so long ago as not to leave
much mark of its occurrence upon her now, either in face or clothes.&nbsp;
She had resumed the mob-cap of her early married life, enlivening its
whiteness by a few rose-du-Barry ribbons.&nbsp; Sally required no such
aids to pinkness.&nbsp; Roseate good-nature lit up her gaze; her features
showed curves of decision and judgment; and she might have been regarded
without much mistake as a warm-hearted, quick-spirited, handsome girl.</p>
<p>She did most of the talking, her mother listening with a half-absent
air, as she picked up fragments of red-hot wood ember with the tongs,
and piled them upon the brands.&nbsp; But the number of speeches that
passed was very small in proportion to the meanings exchanged.&nbsp;
Long experience together often enabled them to see the course of thought
in each other&rsquo;s minds without a word being spoken.&nbsp; Behind
them, in the centre of the room, the table was spread for supper, certain
whiffs of air laden with fat vapours, which ever and anon entered from
the kitchen, denoting its preparation there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The new gown he was going to send you stays about on the way
like himself,&rsquo; Sally&rsquo;s mother was saying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, not finished, I daresay,&rsquo; cried Sally independently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lord, I shouldn&rsquo;t be amazed if it didn&rsquo;t come at
all!&nbsp; Young men make such kind promises when they are near you,
and forget &rsquo;em when they go away.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t intend
it as a wedding-gown&mdash;he gives it to me merely as a gown to wear
when I like&mdash;a travelling-dress is what it would be called by some.&nbsp;
Come rathe or come late it don&rsquo;t much matter, as I have a dress
of my own to fall back upon.&nbsp; But what time is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went to the family clock and opened the glass, for the hour was
not otherwise discernible by night, and indeed at all times was rather
a thing to be investigated than beheld, so much more wall than window
was there in the apartment.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is nearly eight,&rsquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock, and neither dress nor man,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, if you think to tantalize me by talking like that,
you are much mistaken!&nbsp; Let him be as late as he will&mdash;or
stay away altogether&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; said Sally.&nbsp;
But a tender, minute quaver in the negation showed that there was something
forced in that statement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall perceived it, and drily observed that she was not so sure
about Sally not caring.&nbsp; &lsquo;But perhaps you don&rsquo;t care
so much as I do, after all,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;For I see
what you don&rsquo;t, that it is a good and flourishing match for you;
a very honourable offer in Mr. Darton.&nbsp; And I think I see a kind
husband in him.&nbsp; So pray God &rsquo;twill go smooth, and wind up
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sally would not listen to misgivings.&nbsp; Of course it would go
smoothly, she asserted.&nbsp; &lsquo;How you are up and down, mother!&rsquo;
she went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;At this moment, whatever hinders him, we are
not so anxious to see him as he is to be here, and his thought runs
on before him, and settles down upon us like the star in the east.&nbsp;
Hark!&rsquo; she exclaimed, with a breath of relief, her eyes sparkling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I heard something.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;here they are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next moment her mother&rsquo;s slower ear also distinguished
the familiar reverberation occasioned by footsteps clambering up the
roots of the sycamore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes it sounds like them at last,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
it is not so very late after all, considering the distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The footfall ceased, and they arose, expecting a knock.&nbsp; They
began to think it might have been, after all, some neighbouring villager
under Bacchic influence, giving the centre of the road a wide berth,
when their doubts were dispelled by the new-comer&rsquo;s entry into
the passage.&nbsp; The door of the room was gently opened, and there
appeared, not the pair of travellers with whom we have already made
acquaintance, but a pale-faced man in the garb of extreme poverty&mdash;almost
in rags.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s a tramp&mdash;gracious me!&rsquo; said Sally,
starting back.</p>
<p>His cheeks and eye-orbits were deep concaves&mdash;rather, it might
be, from natural weakness of constitution than irregular living, though
there were indications that he had led no careful life.&nbsp; He gazed
at the two women fixedly for a moment: then with an abashed, humiliated
demeanour, dropped his glance to the floor, and sank into a chair without
uttering a word.</p>
<p>Sally was in advance of her mother, who had remained standing by
the fire.&nbsp; She now tried to discern the visitor across the candles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;mother,&rsquo; said Sally faintly, turning back
to Mrs. Hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is Phil, from Australia!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall started, and grew pale, and a fit of coughing seized the
man with the ragged clothes.&nbsp; &lsquo;To come home like this!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, Philip&mdash;are you ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, mother,&rsquo; replied he impatiently, as soon as
he could speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for God&rsquo;s sake how do you come here&mdash;and just
now too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am here,&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;How it
is I hardly know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come home, mother, because I was
driven to it.&nbsp; Things were against me out there, and went from
bad to worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you let us know?&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
not writ a line for the last two or three years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The son admitted sadly that he had not.&nbsp; He said that he had
hoped and thought he might fetch up again, and be able to send good
news.&nbsp; Then he had been obliged to abandon that hope, and had finally
come home from sheer necessity&mdash;previously to making a new start.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, things are very bad with me,&rsquo; he repeated, perceiving
their commiserating glances at his clothes.</p>
<p>They brought him nearer the fire, took his hat from his thin hand,
which was so small and smooth as to show that his attempts to fetch
up again had not been in a manual direction.&nbsp; His mother resumed
her inquiries, and dubiously asked if he had chosen to come that particular
night for any special reason.</p>
<p>For no reason, he told her.&nbsp; His arrival had been quite at random.&nbsp;
Then Philip Hall looked round the room, and saw for the first time that
the table was laid somewhat luxuriously, and for a larger number than
themselves; and that an air of festivity pervaded their dress.&nbsp;
He asked quickly what was going on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sally is going to be married in a day or two,&rsquo; replied
the mother; and she explained how Mr. Darton, Sally&rsquo;s intended
husband, was coming there that night with the groomsman, Mr. Johns,
and other details.&nbsp; &lsquo;We thought it must be their step when
we heard you,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>The needy wanderer looked again on the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see&mdash;I
see,&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, indeed, should I have come
to-night?&nbsp; Such folk as I are not wanted here at these times, naturally.&nbsp;
And I have no business here&mdash;spoiling other people&rsquo;s happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phil,&rsquo; said his mother, with a tear in her eye, but
with a thinness of lip and severity of manner which were presumably
not more than past events justified; &lsquo;since you speak like that
to me, I&rsquo;ll speak honestly to you.&nbsp; For these three years
you have taken no thought for us.&nbsp; You left home with a good supply
of money, and strength and education, and you ought to have made good
use of it all.&nbsp; But you come back like a beggar; and that you come
in a very awkward time for us cannot be denied.&nbsp; Your return to-night
may do us much harm.&nbsp; But mind&mdash;you are welcome to this home
as long as it is mine.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to turn you adrift.&nbsp;
We will make the best of a bad job; and I hope you are not seriously
ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; I have only this infernal cough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you had better
go to bed at once,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I shall be out of the way there,&rsquo; said the
son wearily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Having ruined myself, don&rsquo;t let me ruin
you by being seen in these togs, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Who
do you say Sally is going to be married to&mdash;a Farmer Darton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;a gentleman-farmer&mdash;quite a wealthy man.&nbsp;
Far better in station than she could have expected.&nbsp; It is a good
thing, altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, little Sal!&rsquo; said her brother, brightening
and looking up at her with a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to have written;
but perhaps I have thought of you all the more.&nbsp; But let me get
out of sight.&nbsp; I would rather go and jump into the river than be
seen here.&nbsp; But have you anything I can drink?&nbsp; I am confoundedly
thirsty with my long tramp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, we will bring something upstairs to you,&rsquo;
said Sally, with grief in her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, that will do nicely.&nbsp; But, Sally and mother&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He stopped, and they waited.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mother, I have not told you
all,&rsquo; he resumed slowly, still looking on the floor between his
knees.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sad as what you see of me is, there&rsquo;s worse
behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His mother gazed upon him in grieved suspense, and Sally went and
leant upon the bureau, listening for every sound, and sighing.&nbsp;
Suddenly she turned round, saying, &lsquo;Let them come, I don&rsquo;t
care!&nbsp; Philip, tell the worst, and take your time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said the unhappy Phil, &lsquo;I am not
the only one in this mess.&nbsp; Would to Heaven I were!&nbsp; But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Phil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a wife as destitute as I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wife?&rsquo; said his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unhappily!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wife!&nbsp; Yes, that is the way with sons!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And besides&mdash;&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides!&nbsp; O, Philip, surely&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have two little children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wife and children!&rsquo; whispered Mrs. Hall, sinking down
confounded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little things!&rsquo; said Sally involuntarily.</p>
<p>His mother turned again to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose these helpless
beings are left in Australia?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; They are in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can only hope you&rsquo;ve left them in a respectable
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not left them at all.&nbsp; They are here&mdash;within
a few yards of us.&nbsp; In short, they are in the stable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the stable.&nbsp; I did not like to bring them indoors
till I had seen you, mother, and broken the bad news a bit to you.&nbsp;
They were very tired, and are resting out there on some straw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s fortitude visibly broke down.&nbsp; She had been
brought up not without refinement, and was even more moved by such a
collapse of genteel aims as this than a substantial dairyman&rsquo;s
widow would in ordinary have been moved.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, it must
be borne,&rsquo; she said, in a low voice, with her hands tightly joined.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A starving son, a starving wife, starving children!&nbsp; Let
it be.&nbsp; But why is this come to us now, to-day, to-night?&nbsp;
Could no other misfortune happen to helpless women than this, which
will quite upset my poor girl&rsquo;s chance of a happy life?&nbsp;
Why have you done us this wrong, Philip?&nbsp; What respectable man
will come here, and marry open-eyed into a family of vagabonds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, mother!&rsquo; said Sally vehemently, while her
face flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Charley isn&rsquo;t the man to desert me.&nbsp;
But if he should be, and won&rsquo;t marry me because Phil&rsquo;s come,
let him go and marry elsewhere.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be ashamed of my
own flesh and blood for any man in England&mdash;not I!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then Sally turned away and burst into tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait till you are twenty years older and you will tell a different
tale,&rsquo; replied her mother.</p>
<p>The son stood up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said bitterly, &lsquo;as
I have come, so I will go.&nbsp; All I ask of you is that you will allow
me and mine to lie in your stable to-night.&nbsp; I give you my word
that we&rsquo;ll be gone by break of day, and trouble you no further!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall, the mother, changed at that.&nbsp; &lsquo;O no,&rsquo;
she answered hastily; &lsquo;never shall it be said that I sent any
of my own family from my door.&nbsp; Bring &rsquo;em in, Philip, or
take me out to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will put &rsquo;em all into the large bedroom,&rsquo; said
Sally, brightening, &lsquo;and make up a large fire.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
go and help them in, and call Rebekah.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Rebekah was the
woman who assisted at the dairy and housework; she lived in a cottage
hard by with her husband, who attended to the cows.)</p>
<p>Sally went to fetch a lantern from the back-kitchen, but her brother
said, &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t want a light.&nbsp; I lit the lantern that
was hanging there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What must we call your wife?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Helena,&rsquo; said Philip.</p>
<p>With shawls over their heads they proceeded towards the back door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One minute before you go,&rsquo; interrupted Philip.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t confessed all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Heaven help us!&rsquo; said Mrs. Hall, pushing to the
door and clasping her hands in calm despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We passed through Evershead as we came,&rsquo; he continued,
&lsquo;and I just looked in at the &ldquo;Sow-and-Acorn&rdquo; to see
if old Mike still kept on there as usual.&nbsp; The carrier had come
in from Sherton Abbas at that moment, and guessing that I was bound
for this place&mdash;for I think he knew me&mdash;he asked me to bring
on a dressmaker&rsquo;s parcel for Sally that was marked &ldquo;immediate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
My wife had walked on with the children.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a flimsy
parcel, and the paper was torn, and I found on looking at it that it
was a thick warm gown.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t wish you to see poor Helena
in a shabby state.&nbsp; I was ashamed that you should&mdash;&rsquo;twas
not what she was born to.&nbsp; I untied the parcel in the road, took
it on to her where she was waiting in the Lower Barn, and told her I
had managed to get it for her, and that she was to ask no question.&nbsp;
She, poor thing, must have supposed I obtained it on trust, through
having reached a place where I was known, for she put it on gladly enough.&nbsp;
She has it on now.&nbsp; Sally has other gowns, I daresay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sally looked at her mother, speechless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have others, I daresay!&rsquo; repeated Phil, with a sick
man&rsquo;s impatience.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought to myself, &ldquo;Better
Sally cry than Helena freeze.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, is the dress of great
consequence?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nothing very ornamental, as far as I
could see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no; not of consequence,&rsquo; returned Sally sadly,
adding in a gentle voice, &lsquo;You will not mind if I lend her another
instead of that one, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Philip&rsquo;s agitation at the confession had brought on another
attack of the cough, which seemed to shake him to pieces.&nbsp; He was
so obviously unfit to sit in a chair that they helped him upstairs at
once; and having hastily given him a cordial and kindled the bedroom
fire, they descended to fetch their unhappy new relations.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>It was with strange feelings that the girl and her mother, lately
so cheerful, passed out of the back door into the open air of the barton,
laden with hay scents and the herby breath of cows.&nbsp; A fine sleet
had begun to fall, and they trotted across the yard quickly.&nbsp; The
stable-door was open; a light shone from it&mdash;from the lantern which
always hung there, and which Philip had lighted, as he said.&nbsp; Softly
nearing the door, Mrs. Hall pronounced the name &lsquo;Helena!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer for the moment.&nbsp; Looking in she was taken
by surprise.&nbsp; Two people appeared before her.&nbsp; For one, instead
of the drabbish woman she had expected, Mrs. Hall saw a pale, dark-eyed,
ladylike creature, whose personality ruled her attire rather than was
ruled by it.&nbsp; She was in a new and handsome gown, of course, and
an old bonnet.&nbsp; She was standing up, agitated; her hand was held
by her companion&mdash;none else than Sally&rsquo;s affianced, Farmer
Charles Darton, upon whose fine figure the pale stranger&rsquo;s eyes
were fixed, as his were fixed upon her.&nbsp; His other hand held the
rein of his horse, which was standing saddled as if just led in.</p>
<p>At sight of Mrs. Hall they both turned, looking at her in a way neither
quite conscious nor unconscious, and without seeming to recollect that
words were necessary as a solution to the scene.&nbsp; In another moment
Sally entered also, when Mr. Darton dropped his companion&rsquo;s hand,
led the horse aside, and came to greet his betrothed and Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said, smiling&mdash;with something like forced
composure&mdash;&lsquo;this is a roundabout way of arriving, you will
say, my dear Mrs. Hall.&nbsp; But we lost our way, which made us late.&nbsp;
I saw a light here, and led in my horse at once&mdash;my friend Johns
and my man have gone back to the little inn with theirs, not to crowd
you too much.&nbsp; No sooner had I entered than I saw that this lady
had taken temporary shelter here&mdash;and found I was intruding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is my daughter-in-law,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hall calmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My son, too, is in the house, but he has gone to bed unwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sally had stood staring wonderingly at the scene until this moment,
hardly recognizing Darton&rsquo;s shake of the hand.&nbsp; The spell
that bound her was broken by her perceiving the two little children
seated on a heap of hay.&nbsp; She suddenly went forward, spoke to them,
and took one on her arm and the other in her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And two children?&rsquo; said Mr. Darton, showing thus that
he had not been there long enough as yet to understand the situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My grandchildren,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hall, with as much affected
ease as before.</p>
<p>Philip Hall&rsquo;s wife, in spite of this interruption to her first
rencounter, seemed scarcely so much affected by it as to feel any one&rsquo;s
presence in addition to Mr. Darton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; However, arousing
herself by a quick reflection, she threw a sudden critical glance of
her sad eyes upon Mrs. Hall; and, apparently finding her satisfactory,
advanced to her in a meek initiative.&nbsp; Then Sally and the stranger
spoke some friendly words to each other, and Sally went on with the
children into the house.&nbsp; Mrs. Hall and Helena followed, and Mr.
Darton followed these, looking at Helena&rsquo;s dress and outline,
and listening to her voice like a man in a dream.</p>
<p>By the time the others reached the house Sally had already gone upstairs
with the tired children.&nbsp; She rapped against the wall for Rebekah
to come in and help to attend to them, Rebekah&rsquo;s house being a
little &lsquo;spit-and-dab&rsquo; cabin leaning against the substantial
stone-work of Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s taller erection.&nbsp; When she came
a bed was made up for the little ones, and some supper given to them.&nbsp;
On descending the stairs after seeing this done Sally went to the sitting-room.&nbsp;
Young Mrs. Hall entered it just in advance of her, having in the interim
retired with her mother-in-law to take off her bonnet, and otherwise
make herself presentable.&nbsp; Hence it was evident that no further
communication could have passed between her and Mr. Darton since their
brief interview in the stable.</p>
<p>Mr. Japheth Johns now opportunely arrived, and broke up the restraint
of the company, after a few orthodox meteorological commentaries had
passed between him and Mrs. Hall by way of introduction.&nbsp; They
at once sat down to supper, the present of wine and turkey not being
produced for consumption to-night, lest the premature display of those
gifts should seem to throw doubt on Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s capacities as
a provider.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drink hearty, Mr. Johns&mdash;drink hearty,&rsquo; said that
matron magnanimously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such as it is there&rsquo;s plenty
of.&nbsp; But perhaps cider-wine is not to your taste?&mdash;though
there&rsquo;s body in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite the contrairy, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;quite the contrairy,&rsquo;
said the dairyman.&nbsp; &lsquo;For though I inherit the malt-liquor
principle from my father, I am a cider-drinker on my mother&rsquo;s
side.&nbsp; She came from these parts, you know.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s
this to be said for&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;tis a more peaceful liquor,
and don&rsquo;t lie about a man like your hotter drinks.&nbsp; With
care, one may live on it a twelvemonth without knocking down a neighbour,
or getting a black eye from an old acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The general conversation thus begun was continued briskly, though
it was in the main restricted to Mrs. Hall and Japheth, who in truth
required but little help from anybody.&nbsp; There being slight call
upon Sally&rsquo;s tongue, she had ample leisure to do what her heart
most desired, namely, watch her intended husband and her sister-in-law
with a view of elucidating the strange momentary scene in which her
mother and herself had surprised them in the stable.&nbsp; If that scene
meant anything, it meant, at least, that they had met before.&nbsp;
That there had been no time for explanations Sally could see, for their
manner was still one of suppressed amazement at each other&rsquo;s presence
there.&nbsp; Darton&rsquo;s eyes, too, fell continually on the gown
worn by Helena as if this were an added riddle to his perplexity; though
to Sally it was the one feature in the case which was no mystery.&nbsp;
He seemed to feel that fate had impishly changed his vis-&agrave;-vis
in the lover&rsquo;s jig he was about to foot; that while the gown had
been expected to enclose a Sally, a Helena&rsquo;s face looked out from
the bodice; that some long-lost hand met his own from the sleeves.</p>
<p>Sally could see that whatever Helena might know of Darton, she knew
nothing of how the dress entered into his embarrassment.&nbsp; And at
moments the young girl would have persuaded herself that Darton&rsquo;s
looks at her sister-in-law were entirely the fruit of the clothes query.&nbsp;
But surely at other times a more extensive range of speculation and
sentiment was expressed by her lover&rsquo;s eye than that which the
changed dress would account for.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s independence made her one of the least jealous of women.&nbsp;
But there was something in the relations of these two visitors which
ought to be explained.</p>
<p>Japheth Johns continued to converse in his well-known style, interspersing
his talk with some private reflections on the position of Darton and
Sally, which, though the sparkle in his eye showed them to be highly
entertaining to himself, were apparently not quite communicable to the
company.&nbsp; At last he withdrew for the night, going off to the roadside
inn half-a-mile back, whither Darton promised to follow him in a few
minutes.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour passed, and then Mr. Darton also rose to leave, Sally
and her sister-in-law simultaneously wishing him good-night as they
retired upstairs to their rooms.&nbsp; But on his arriving at the front
door with Mrs. Hall a sharp shower of rain began to come down, when
the widow suggested that he should return to the fire-side till the
storm ceased.</p>
<p>Darton accepted her proposal, but insisted that, as it was getting
late, and she was obviously tired, she should not sit up on his account,
since he could let himself out of the house, and would quite enjoy smoking
a pipe by the hearth alone.&nbsp; Mrs. Hall assented; and Darton was
left by himself.&nbsp; He spread his knees to the brands, lit up his
tobacco as he had said, and sat gazing into the fire, and at the notches
of the chimney-crook which hung above.</p>
<p>An occasional drop of rain rolled down the chimney with a hiss, and
still he smoked on; but not like a man whose mind was at rest.&nbsp;
In the long run, however, despite his meditations, early hours afield
and a long ride in the open air produced their natural result.&nbsp;
He began to doze.</p>
<p>How long he remained in this half-unconscious state he did not know.&nbsp;
He suddenly opened his eyes.&nbsp; The back-brand had burnt itself in
two, and ceased to flame; the light which he had placed on the mantelpiece
had nearly gone out.&nbsp; But in spite of these deficiencies there
was a light in the apartment, and it came from elsewhere.&nbsp; Turning
his head he saw Philip Hall&rsquo;s wife standing at the entrance of
the room with a bed-candle in one hand, a small brass tea-kettle in
the other, and <i>his</i> gown, as it certainly seemed, still upon her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Helena!&rsquo; said Darton, starting up.</p>
<p>Her countenance expressed dismay, and her first words were an apology.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;did not know you were here, Mr. Darton,&rsquo; she said,
while a blush flashed to her cheek.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought every one
had retired&mdash;I was coming to make a little water boil; my husband
seems to be worse.&nbsp; But perhaps the kitchen fire can be lighted
up again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go on my account.&nbsp; By all means put it on
here as you intended,&rsquo; said Darton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Allow me to help
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went forward to take the kettle from her hand,
but she did not allow him, and placed it on the fire herself.</p>
<p>They stood some way apart, one on each side of the fireplace, waiting
till the water should boil, the candle on the mantel between them, and
Helena with her eyes on the kettle.&nbsp; Darton was the first to break
the silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I call Sally?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; she quickly returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have given
trouble enough already.&nbsp; We have no right here.&nbsp; But we are
the sport of fate, and were obliged to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No right here!&rsquo; said he in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain it now,&rsquo; answered
Helena.&nbsp; &lsquo;This kettle is very slow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause; the proverbial dilatoriness of watched pots
was never more clearly exemplified.</p>
<p>Helena&rsquo;s face was of that sort which seems to ask for assistance
without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge&mdash;the very antipodes of Sally&rsquo;s,
which was self-reliance expressed.&nbsp; Darton&rsquo;s eyes travelled
from the kettle to Helena&rsquo;s face, then back to the kettle, then
to the face for rather a longer time.&nbsp; &lsquo;So I am not to know
anything of the mystery that has distracted me all the evening?&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is it that a woman, who refused me because
(as I supposed) my position was not good enough for her taste, is found
to be the wife of a man who certainly seems to be worse off than I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had the prior claim,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you knew him at that time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; Please say no more,&rsquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever my errors, I have paid for them during the last five
years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The heart of Darton was subject to sudden overflowings.&nbsp; He
was kind to a fault.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry from my soul,&rsquo; he
said, involuntarily approaching her.&nbsp; Helena withdrew a step or
two, at which he became conscious of his movement, and quickly took
his former place.&nbsp; Here he stood without speaking, and the little
kettle began to sing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you might have been my wife if you had chosen,&rsquo;
he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;But that&rsquo;s all past and gone.&nbsp;
However, if you are in any trouble or poverty I shall be glad to be
of service, and as your relation by marriage I shall have a right to
be.&nbsp; Does your uncle know of your distress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My uncle is dead.&nbsp; He left me without a farthing.&nbsp;
And now we have two children to maintain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, left you nothing?&nbsp; How could he be so cruel as
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I disgraced myself in his eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Darton earnestly, &lsquo;let me take care
of the children, at least while you are so unsettled.&nbsp; <i>You</i>
belong to another, so I cannot take care of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes you can,&rsquo; said a voice; and suddenly a third figure
stood beside them.&nbsp; It was Sally.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can, since you
seem to wish to?&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;She no longer belongs
to another . . . My poor brother is dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face was red, her eyes sparkled, and all the woman came to the
front.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have heard it!&rsquo; she went on to him passionately.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can protect her now as well as the children!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She turned then to her agitated sister-in-law.&nbsp; &lsquo;I heard
something,&rsquo; said Sally (in a gentle murmur, differing much from
her previous passionate words), &lsquo;and I went into his room.&nbsp;
It must have been the moment you left.&nbsp; He went off so quickly,
and weakly, and it was so unexpected, that I couldn&rsquo;t leave even
to call you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Darton was just able to gather from the confused discourse which
followed that, during his sleep by the fire, this brother whom he had
never seen had become worse; and that during Helena&rsquo;s absence
for water the end had unexpectedly come.&nbsp; The two young women hastened
upstairs, and he was again left alone.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After standing there a short time he went to the front door and looked
out; till, softly closing it behind him, he advanced and stood under
the large sycamore-tree.&nbsp; The stars were flickering coldly, and
the dampness which had just descended upon the earth in rain now sent
up a chill from it.&nbsp; Darton was in a strange position, and he felt
it.&nbsp; The unexpected appearance, in deep poverty, of Helena&mdash;a
young lady, daughter of a deceased naval officer, who had been brought
up by her uncle, a solicitor, and had refused Darton in marriage years
ago&mdash;the passionate, almost angry demeanour of Sally at discovering
them, the abrupt announcement that Helena was a widow; all this coming
together was a conjuncture difficult to cope with in a moment, and made
him question whether he ought to leave the house or offer assistance.&nbsp;
But for Sally&rsquo;s manner he would unhesitatingly have done the latter.</p>
<p>He was still standing under the tree when the door in front of him
opened, and Mrs. Hall came out.&nbsp; She went round to the garden-gate
at the side without seeing him.&nbsp; Darton followed her, intending
to speak.</p>
<p>Pausing outside, as if in thought, she proceeded to a spot where
the sun came earliest in spring-time, and where the north wind never
blew; it was where the row of beehives stood under the wall.&nbsp; Discerning
her object, he waited till she had accomplished it.</p>
<p>It was the universal custom thereabout to wake the bees by tapping
at their hives whenever a death occurred in the household, under the
belief that if this were not done the bees themselves would pine away
and perish during the ensuing year.&nbsp; As soon as an interior buzzing
responded to her tap at the first hive Mrs. Hall went on to the second,
and thus passed down the row.&nbsp; As soon as she came back he met
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can I do in this trouble, Mrs. Hall?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;nothing, thank you, nothing,&rsquo; she said in a
tearful voice, now just perceiving him.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have called
Rebekah and her husband, and they will do everything necessary.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She told him in a few words the particulars of her son&rsquo;s arrival,
broken in health&mdash;indeed, at death&rsquo;s very door, though they
did not suspect it&mdash;and suggested, as the result of a conversation
between her and her daughter, that the wedding should be postponed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; said Darton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think now
to go straight to the inn and tell Johns what has happened.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was not till after he had shaken hands with her that he turned hesitatingly
and added, &lsquo;Will you tell the mother of his children that, as
they are now left fatherless, I shall be glad to take the eldest of
them, if it would be any convenience to her and to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall promised that her son&rsquo;s widow should he told of the
offer, and they parted.&nbsp; He retired down the rooty slope and disappeared
in the direction of the inn, where he informed Johns of the circumstances.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Mrs. Hall had entered the house, Sally was downstairs in the
sitting-room alone, and her mother explained to her that Darton had
readily assented to the postponement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt he has,&rsquo; said Sally, with sad emphasis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not put off for a week, or a month, or a year.&nbsp; I
shall never marry him, and she will!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>Time passed, and the household on the Knap became again serene under
the composing influences of daily routine.&nbsp; A desultory, very desultory
correspondence, dragged on between Sally Hall and Darton, who, not quite
knowing how to take her petulant words on the night of her brother&rsquo;s
death, had continued passive thus long.&nbsp; Helena and her children
remained at the dairy-house, almost of necessity, and Darton therefore
deemed it advisable to stay away.</p>
<p>One day, seven months later on, when Mr. Darton was as usual at his
farm, twenty miles from Hintock, a note reached him from Helena.&nbsp;
She thanked him for his kind offer about her children, which her mother-in-law
had duly communicated, and stated that she would be glad to accept it
as regarded the eldest, the boy.&nbsp; Helena had, in truth, good need
to do so, for her uncle had left her penniless, and all application
to some relatives in the north had failed.&nbsp; There was, besides,
as she said, no good school near Hintock to which she could send the
child.</p>
<p>On a fine summer day the boy came.&nbsp; He was accompanied half-way
by Sally and his mother&mdash;to the &lsquo;White Horse,&rsquo; at Chalk
Newton&mdash;where he was handed over to Darton&rsquo;s bailiff in a
shining spring-cart, who met them there.</p>
<p>He was entered as a day-scholar at a popular school at Casterbridge,
three or four miles from Darton&rsquo;s, having first been taught by
Darton to ride a forest-pony, on which he cantered to and from the aforesaid
fount of knowledge, and (as Darton hoped) brought away a promising headful
of the same at each diurnal expedition.&nbsp; The thoughtful taciturnity
into which Darton had latterly fallen was quite dissipated by the presence
of this boy.</p>
<p>When the Christmas holidays came it was arranged that he should spend
them with his mother.&nbsp; The journey was, for some reason or other,
performed in two stages, as at his coming, except that Darton in person
took the place of the bailiff, and that the boy and himself rode on
horseback.</p>
<p>Reaching the renowned &lsquo;White Horse,&rsquo; Darton inquired
if Miss and young Mrs. Hall were there to meet little Philip (as they
had agreed to be).&nbsp; He was answered by the appearance of Helena
alone at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the last moment Sally would not come,&rsquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>That meeting practically settled the point towards which these long-severed
persons were converging.&nbsp; But nothing was broached about it for
some time yet.&nbsp; Sally Hall had, in fact, imparted the first decisive
motion to events by refusing to accompany Helena.&nbsp; She soon gave
them a second move by writing the following note</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;[Private.]</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Living here so long and intimately with
Helena, I have naturally learnt her history, especially that of it which
refers to you.&nbsp; I am sure she would accept you as a husband at
the proper time, and I think you ought to give her the opportunity.&nbsp;
You inquire in an old note if I am sorry that I showed temper (which
it wasn&rsquo;t) that night when I heard you talking to her.&nbsp; No,
Charles, I am not sorry at all for what I said then.&mdash;Yours sincerely,
SALLY HALL.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus set in train, the transfer of Darton&rsquo;s heart back to its
original quarters proceeded by mere lapse of time.&nbsp; In the following
July, Darton went to his friend Japheth to ask him at last to fulfil
the bridal office which had been in abeyance since the previous January
twelvemonths.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart, man o&rsquo; constancy!&rsquo; said Dairyman
Johns warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost most of my genteel fair complexion
haymaking this hot weather, &rsquo;tis true, but I&rsquo;ll do your
business as well as them that look better.&nbsp; There be scents and
good hair-oil in the world yet, thank God, and they&rsquo;ll take off
the roughest o&rsquo; my edge.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll compliment her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better late than never, Sally Hall,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not Sally,&rsquo; said Darton hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is young Mrs. Hall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Japheth&rsquo;s face, as soon as he really comprehended, became a
picture of reproachful dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not Sally?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why not Sally?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe it!&nbsp; Young Mrs.
Hall!&nbsp; Well, well&mdash;where&rsquo;s your wisdom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Darton shortly explained particulars; but Johns would not be reconciled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She was a woman worth having if ever woman was,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And now to let her go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I suppose I can marry where I like,&rsquo; said Darton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; replied the dairyman, lifting his eyebrows
expressively.&nbsp; &lsquo;This don&rsquo;t become you, Charles&mdash;it
really do not.&nbsp; If I had done such a thing you would have sworn
I was a curst no&rsquo;thern fool to be drawn off the scent by such
a red-herring doll-oll-oll.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Darton responded in such sharp terms to this laconic opinion
that the two friends finally parted in a way they had never parted before.&nbsp;
Johns was to be no groomsman to Darton after all.&nbsp; He had flatly
declined.&nbsp; Darton went off sorry, and even unhappy, particularly
as Japheth was about to leave that side of the county, so that the words
which had divided them were not likely to be explained away or softened
down.</p>
<p>A short time after the interview Darton was united to Helena at a
simple matter-of fact wedding; and she and her little girl joined the
boy who had already grown to look on Darton&rsquo;s house as home.</p>
<p>For some months the farmer experienced an unprecedented happiness
and satisfaction.&nbsp; There had been a flaw in his life, and it was
as neatly mended as was humanly possible.&nbsp; But after a season the
stream of events followed less clearly, and there were shades in his
reveries.&nbsp; Helena was a fragile woman, of little staying power,
physically or morally, and since the time that he had originally known
her&mdash;eight or ten years before&mdash;she had been severely tried.&nbsp;
She had loved herself out, in short, and was now occasionally given
to moping.&nbsp; Sometimes she spoke regretfully of the gentilities
of her early life, and instead of comparing her present state with her
condition as the wife of the unlucky Hall, she mused rather on what
it had been before she took the first fatal step of clandestinely marrying
him.&nbsp; She did not care to please such people as those with whom
she was thrown as a thriving farmer&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She allowed
the pretty trifles of agricultural domesticity to glide by her as sorry
details, and had it not been for the children Darton&rsquo;s house would
have seemed but little brighter than it had been before.</p>
<p>This led to occasional unpleasantness, until Darton sometimes declared
to himself that such endeavours as his to rectify early deviations of
the heart by harking back to the old point mostly failed of success.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps Johns was right,&rsquo; he would say.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should have gone on with Sally.&nbsp; Better go with the tide and make
the best of its course than stem it at the risk of a capsize.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But he kept these unmelodious thoughts to himself, and was outwardly
considerate and kind.</p>
<p>This somewhat barren tract of his life had extended to less than
a year and a half when his ponderings were cut short by the loss of
the woman they concerned.&nbsp; When she was in her grave he thought
better of her than when she had been alive; the farm was a worse place
without her than with her, after all.&nbsp; No woman short of divine
could have gone through such an experience as hers with her first husband
without becoming a little soured.&nbsp; Her stagnant sympathies, her
sometimes unreasonable manner, had covered a heart frank and well meaning,
and originally hopeful and warm.&nbsp; She left him a tiny red infant
in white wrappings.&nbsp; To make life as easy as possible to this touching
object became at once his care.</p>
<p>As this child learnt to walk and talk Darton learnt to see feasibility
in a scheme which pleased him.&nbsp; Revolving the experiment which
he had hitherto made upon life, he fancied he had gained wisdom from
his mistakes and caution from his miscarriages.</p>
<p>What the scheme was needs no penetration to discover.&nbsp; Once
more he had opportunity to recast and rectify his ill-wrought situations
by returning to Sally Hall, who still lived quietly on under her mother&rsquo;s
roof at Hintock.&nbsp; Helena had been a woman to lend pathos and refinement
to a home; Sally was the woman to brighten it.&nbsp; She would not,
as Helena did, despise the rural simplicities of a farmer&rsquo;s fireside.&nbsp;
Moreover, she had a pre-eminent qualification for Darton&rsquo;s household;
no other woman could make so desirable a mother to her brother&rsquo;s
two children and Darton&rsquo;s one as Sally&mdash;while Darton, now
that Helena had gone, was a more promising husband for Sally than he
had ever been when liable to reminders from an uncured sentimental wound.</p>
<p>Darton was not a man to act rapidly, and the working out of his reparative
designs might have been delayed for some time.&nbsp; But there came
a winter evening precisely like the one which had darkened over that
former ride to Hintock, and he asked himself why he should postpone
longer, when the very landscape called for a repetition of that attempt.</p>
<p>He told his man to saddle the mare, booted and spurred himself with
a younger horseman&rsquo;s nicety, kissed the two youngest children,
and rode off.&nbsp; To make the journey a complete parallel to the first,
he would fain have had his old acquaintance Japheth Johns with him.&nbsp;
But Johns, alas! was missing.&nbsp; His removal to the other side of
the county had left unrepaired the breach which had arisen between him
and Darton; and though Darton had forgiven him a hundred times, as Johns
had probably forgiven Darton, the effort of reunion in present circumstances
was one not likely to be made.</p>
<p>He screwed himself up to as cheerful a pitch as he could without
his former crony, and became content with his own thoughts as he rode,
instead of the words of a companion.&nbsp; The sun went down; the boughs
appeared scratched in like an etching against the sky; old crooked men
with faggots at their backs said &lsquo;Good-night, sir,&rsquo; and
Darton replied &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo; right heartily.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the forking roads it was getting as dark as
it had been on the occasion when Johns climbed the directing-post.&nbsp;
Darton made no mistake this time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor shall I be able to
mistake, thank Heaven, when I arrive,&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; It gave
him peculiar satisfaction to think that the proposed marriage, like
his first, was of the nature of setting in order things long awry, and
not a momentary freak of fancy.</p>
<p>Nothing hindered the smoothness of his journey, which seemed not
half its former length.&nbsp; Though dark, it was only between five
and six o&rsquo;clock when the bulky chimneys of Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s residence
appeared in view behind the sycamore-tree.&nbsp; On second thoughts
he retreated and put up at the ale-house as in former time; and when
he had plumed himself before the inn mirror, called for something to
drink, and smoothed out the incipient wrinkles of care, he walked on
to the Knap with a quick step.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>That evening Sally was making &lsquo;pinners&rsquo; for the milkers,
who were now increased by two, for her mother and herself no longer
joined in milking the cows themselves.&nbsp; But upon the whole there
was little change in the household economy, and not much in its appearance,
beyond such minor particulars as that the crack over the window, which
had been a hundred years coming, was a trifle wider; that the beams
were a shade blacker; that the influence of modernism had supplanted
the open chimney corner by a grate; that Rebekah, who had worn a cap
when she had plenty of hair, had left it off now she had scarce any,
because it was reported that caps were not fashionable; and that Sally&rsquo;s
face had naturally assumed a more womanly and experienced cast.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall was actually lifting coals with the tongs, as she had used
to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five years ago this very night, if I am not mistaken&mdash;&rsquo;
she said, laying on an ember.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not this very night&mdash;though &rsquo;twas one night this
week,&rsquo; said the correct Sally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, &rsquo;tis near enough.&nbsp; Five years ago Mr. Darton
came to marry you, and my poor boy Phil came home to die.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, Sally,&rsquo; she presently said, &lsquo;if
you had managed well Mr. Darton would have had you, Helena or none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be sentimental about that, mother,&rsquo; begged
Sally.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t care to manage well in such a case.&nbsp;
Though I liked him, I wasn&rsquo;t so anxious.&nbsp; I would never have
married the man in the midst of such a hitch as that was,&rsquo; she
added with decision; &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t think I would if he were
to ask me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure about that, unless you have another in your
eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t; and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.&nbsp; I could
hardly marry him for love at this time o&rsquo; day.&nbsp; And as we&rsquo;ve
quite enough to live on if we give up the dairy to-morrow, I should
have no need to marry for any meaner reason . . . I am quite happy enough
as I am, and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now it was not long after this dialogue that there came a mild rap
at the door, and in a moment there entered Rebekah, looking as though
a ghost had arrived.&nbsp; The fact was that that accomplished skimmer
and churner (now a resident in the house) had overheard the desultory
observations between mother and daughter, and on opening the door to
Mr. Darton thought the coincidence must have a grisly meaning in it.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hall welcomed the farmer with warm surprise, as did Sally, and
for a moment they rather wanted words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you push up the chimney-crook for me, Mr Darton? the notches
hitch,&rsquo; said the matron.&nbsp; He did it, and the homely little
act bridged over the awkward consciousness that he had been a stranger
for four years.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall soon saw what he had come for, and left the principals
together while she went to prepare him a late tea, smiling at Sally&rsquo;s
recent hasty assertions of indifference, when she saw how civil Sally
was.&nbsp; When tea was ready she joined them.&nbsp; She fancied that
Darton did not look so confident as when he had arrived; but Sally was
quite light-hearted, and the meal passed pleasantly.</p>
<p>About seven he took his leave of them.&nbsp; Mrs. Hall went as far
as the door to light him down the slope.&nbsp; On the doorstep he said
frankly&mdash;&lsquo;I came to ask your daughter to marry me; chose
the night and everything, with an eye to a favourable answer.&nbsp;
But she won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she&rsquo;s a very ungrateful girl!&rsquo; emphatically
said Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>Darton paused to shape his sentence, and asked, &lsquo;I&mdash;I
suppose there&rsquo;s nobody else more favoured?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say that there is, or that there isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
answered Mrs. Hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s private in some things.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m on your side, however, Mr. Darton, and I&rsquo;ll talk to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank &lsquo;ee, thank &lsquo;ee!&rsquo; said the farmer in
a gayer accent; and with this assurance the not very satisfactory visit
came to an end.&nbsp; Darton descended the roots of the sycamore, the
light was withdrawn, and the door closed.&nbsp; At the bottom of the
slope he nearly ran against a man about to ascend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can a jack-o&rsquo;-lent believe his few senses on such a
dark night, or can&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; exclaimed one whose utterance
Darton recognized in a moment, despite its unexpectedness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
dare not swear he can, though I fain would!&rsquo;&nbsp; The speaker
was Johns.</p>
<p>Darton said he was glad of this opportunity, bad as it was, of putting
an end to the silence of years, and asked the dairyman what he was travelling
that way for.</p>
<p>Japheth showed the old jovial confidence in a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
going to see your&mdash;relations&mdash;as they always seem to me,&rsquo;
he said&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs. Hall and Sally.&nbsp; Well, Charles, the fact
is I find the natural barbarousness of man is much increased by a bachelor
life, and, as your leavings were always good enough for me, I&rsquo;m
trying civilization here.&rsquo;&nbsp; He nodded towards the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not with Sally&mdash;to marry her?&rsquo; said Darton, feeling
something like a rill of ice water between his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, by the help of Providence and my personal charms.&nbsp;
And I think I shall get her.&nbsp; I am this road every week&mdash;my
present dairy is only four miles off, you know, and I see her through
the window.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rather odd that I was going to speak practical
to-night to her for the first time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve just called?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, for a short while.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t say a word
about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good sign, a good sign.&nbsp; Now that decides me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll swing the mallet and get her answer this very night as I
planned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few more remarks, and Darton, wishing his friend joy of Sally in
a slightly hollow tone of jocularity, bade him good-bye.&nbsp; Johns
promised to write particulars, and ascended, and was lost in the shade
of the house and tree.&nbsp; A rectangle of light appeared when Johns
was admitted, and all was dark again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy Japheth!&rsquo; said Darton.&nbsp; &lsquo;This then
is the explanation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He determined to return home that night.&nbsp; In a quarter of an
hour he passed out of the village, and the next day went about his swede-lifting
and storing as if nothing had occurred.</p>
<p>He waited and waited to hear from Johns whether the wedding-day was
fixed: but no letter came.&nbsp; He learnt not a single particular till,
meeting Johns one day at a horse-auction, Darton exclaimed genially&mdash;rather
more genially than he felt&mdash;&lsquo;When is the joyful day to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To his great surprise a reciprocity of gladness was not conspicuous
in Johns.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he said, in a very subdued
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a bad job; she won&rsquo;t have me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Darton held his breath till he said with treacherous solicitude,
&lsquo;Try again&mdash;&rsquo;tis coyness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said Johns decisively.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
been none of that.&nbsp; We talked it over dozens of times in the most
fair and square way.&nbsp; She tells me plainly, I don&rsquo;t suit
her.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be simply annoying her to ask her again.&nbsp;
Ah, Charles, you threw a prize away when you let her slip five years
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did&mdash;I did,&rsquo; said Darton.</p>
<p>He returned from that auction with a new set of feelings in play.&nbsp;
He had certainly made a surprising mistake in thinking Johns his successful
rival.&nbsp; It really seemed as if he might hope for Sally after all.</p>
<p>This time, being rather pressed by business, Darton had recourse
to pen-and-ink, and wrote her as manly and straightforward a proposal
as any woman could wish to receive.&nbsp; The reply came promptly:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. DARTON,&mdash;I am as sensible as any
woman can be of the goodness that leads you to make me this offer a
second time.&nbsp; Better women than I would be proud of the honour,
for when I read your nice long speeches on mangold-wurzel, and such
like topics, at the Casterbridge Farmers&rsquo; Club, I do feel it an
honour, I assure you.&nbsp; But my answer is just the same as before.&nbsp;
I will not try to explain what, in truth, I cannot explain&mdash;my
reasons; I will simply say that I must decline to be married to you.&nbsp;
With good wishes as in former times, I am, your faithful friend,</p>
<p>&lsquo;SALLY HALL.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darton dropped the letter hopelessly.&nbsp; Beyond the negative,
there was just a possibility of sarcasm in it&mdash;&lsquo;nice long
speeches on mangold-wurzel&rsquo; had a suspicious sound.&nbsp; However,
sarcasm or none, there was the answer, and he had to be content.</p>
<p>He proceeded to seek relief in a business which at this time engrossed
much of his attention&mdash;that of clearing up a curious mistake just
current in the county, that he had been nearly ruined by the recent
failure of a local bank.&nbsp; A farmer named Darton had lost heavily,
and the similarity of name had probably led to the error.&nbsp; Belief
in it was so persistent that it demanded several days of letter-writing
to set matters straight, and persuade the world that he was as solvent
as ever he had been in his life.&nbsp; He had hardly concluded this
worrying task when, to his delight, another letter arrived in the handwriting
of Sally.</p>
<p>Darton tore it open; it was very short.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. DARTON,&mdash;We have been so alarmed
these last few days by the report that you were ruined by the stoppage
of --&lsquo;s Bank, that, now it is contradicted I hasten, by my mother&rsquo;s
wish, to say how truly glad we are to find there is no foundation for
the report.&nbsp; After your kindness to my poor brother&rsquo;s children,
I can do no less than write at such a moment.&nbsp; We had a letter
from each of them a few days ago.&mdash;Your faithful friend,</p>
<p>&lsquo;SALLY HALL.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Mercenary little woman!&rsquo; said Darton to himself with
a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then that was the secret of her refusal this time&mdash;she
thought I was ruined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, such was Darton, that as hours went on he could not help feeling
too generously towards Sally to condemn her in this.&nbsp; What did
he want in a wife? he asked himself.&nbsp; Love and integrity.&nbsp;
What next?&nbsp; Worldly wisdom.&nbsp; And was there really more than
worldly wisdom in her refusal to go aboard a sinking ship?&nbsp; She
now knew it was otherwise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begad,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
try her again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fact was he had so set his heart upon Sally, and Sally alone,
that nothing was to be allowed to baulk him; and his reasoning was purely
formal.</p>
<p>Anniversaries having been unpropitious, he waited on till a bright
day late in May&mdash;a day when all animate nature was fancying, in
its trusting, foolish way, that it was going to bask out of doors for
evermore.&nbsp; As he rode through Long-Ash Lane it was scarce recognizable
as the track of his two winter journeys.&nbsp; No mistake could be made
now, even with his eyes shut.&nbsp; The cuckoo&rsquo;s note was at its
best, between April tentativeness and midsummer decrepitude, and the
reptiles in the sun behaved as winningly as kittens on a hearth.&nbsp;
Though afternoon, and about the same time as on the last occasion, it
was broad day and sunshine when he entered Hintock, and the details
of the Knap dairy-house were visible far up the road.&nbsp; He saw Sally
in the garden, and was set vibrating.&nbsp; He had first intended to
go on to the inn; but &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tie
my horse to the garden-gate.&nbsp; If all goes well it can soon be taken
round: if not, I mount and ride away&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tall shade of the horseman darkened the room in which Mrs. Hall
sat, and made her start, for he had ridden by a side path to the top
of the slope, where riders seldom came.&nbsp; In a few seconds he was
in the garden with Sally.</p>
<p>Five&mdash;ay, three minutes&mdash;did the business at the back of
that row of bees.&nbsp; Though spring had come, and heavenly blue consecrated
the scene, Darton succeeded not.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>No</i>,&rsquo; said
Sally firmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will never, never marry you, Mr. Darton.&nbsp;
I would have done it once; but now I never can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But!&rsquo;&mdash;implored Mr. Darton.&nbsp; And with a burst
of real eloquence he went on to declare all sorts of things that he
would do for her.&nbsp; He would drive her to see her mother every week&mdash;take
her to London&mdash;settle so much money upon her&mdash;Heaven knows
what he did not promise, suggest, and tempt her with.&nbsp; But it availed
nothing.&nbsp; She interposed with a stout negative, which closed the
course of his argument like an iron gate across a highway.&nbsp; Darton
paused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said he simply, &lsquo;you hadn&rsquo;t heard
of my supposed failure when you declined last time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had not,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if I had &rsquo;twould
have been all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And &rsquo;tis not because of any soreness from my slighting
you years ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; That soreness is long past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;then you despise me, Sally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she slowly answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
altogether despise you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you quite such a hero
as I once did&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; The truth is, I am happy
enough as I am; and I don&rsquo;t mean to marry at all.&nbsp; Now, may
<i>I</i> ask a favour, sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke with an ineffable
charm, which, whenever he thought of it, made him curse his loss of
her as long as he lived.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To any extent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please do not put this question to me any more.&nbsp; Friends
as long as you like, but lovers and married never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never will,&rsquo; said Darton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not if I live
a hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he never did.&nbsp; That he had worn out his welcome in her heart
was only too plain.</p>
<p>When his step-children had grown up, and were placed out in life,
all communication between Darton and the Hall family ceased.&nbsp; It
was only by chance that, years after, he learnt that Sally, notwithstanding
the solicitations her attractions drew down upon her, had refused several
offers of marriage, and steadily adhered to her purpose of leading a
single life</p>
<p>May 1884.</p>
<h2>THE DISTRACTED PREACHER</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;HOW HIS COLD WAS CURED</h3>
<p>Something delayed the arrival of the Wesleyan minister, and a young
man came temporarily in his stead.&nbsp; It was on the thirteenth of
January 183- that Mr. Stockdale, the young man in question, made his
humble entry into the village, unknown, and almost unseen.&nbsp; But
when those of the inhabitants who styled themselves of his connection
became acquainted with him, they were rather pleased with the substitute
than otherwise, though he had scarcely as yet acquired ballast of character
sufficient to steady the consciences of the hundred-and-forty Methodists
of pure blood who, at this time, lived in Nether-Moynton, and to give
in addition supplementary support to the mixed race which went to church
in the morning and chapel in the evening, or when there was a tea&mdash;as
many as a hundred-and-ten people more, all told, and including the parish-clerk
in the winter-time, when it was too dark for the vicar to observe who
passed up the street at seven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;which, to be just
to him, he was never anxious to do.</p>
<p>It was owing to this overlapping of creeds that the celebrated population-puzzle
arose among the denser gentry of the district around Nether-Moynton:
how could it be that a parish containing fifteen score of strong full-grown
Episcopalians, and nearly thirteen score of well-matured Dissenters,
numbered barely two-and-twenty score adults in all?</p>
<p>The young man being personally interesting, those with whom he came
in contact were content to waive for a while the graver question of
his sufficiency.&nbsp; It is said that at this time of his life his
eyes were affectionate, though without a ray of levity; that his hair
was curly, and his figure tall; that he was, in short, a very lovable
youth, who won upon his female hearers as soon as they saw and heard
him, and caused them to say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we know of this
before he came, that we might have gied him a warmer welcome!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fact was that, knowing him to be only provisionally selected,
and expecting nothing remarkable in his person or doctrine, they and
the rest of his flock in Nether-Moynton had felt almost as indifferent
about his advent as if they had been the soundest church-going parishioners
in the country, and he their true and appointed parson.&nbsp; Thus when
Stockdale set foot in the place nobody had secured a lodging for him,
and though his journey had given him a bad cold in the head, he was
forced to attend to that business himself.&nbsp; On inquiry he learnt
that the only possible accommodation in the village would be found at
the house of one Mrs. Lizzy Newberry, at the upper end of the street.</p>
<p>It was a youth who gave this information, and Stockdale asked him
who Mrs. Newberry might be.</p>
<p>The boy said that she was a widow-woman, who had got no husband,
because he was dead.&nbsp; Mr. Newberry, he added, had been a well-to-do
man enough, as the saying was, and a farmer; but he had gone off in
a decline.&nbsp; As regarded Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s serious side, Stockdale
gathered that she was one of the trimmers who went to church and chapel
both.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go there,&rsquo; said Stockdale, feeling that,
in the absence of purely sectarian lodgings, he could do no better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a little particular, and won&rsquo;t hae gover&rsquo;ment
folks, or curates, or the pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s friends, or such like,&rsquo;
said the lad dubiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that may be a promising sign: I&rsquo;ll call.&nbsp; Or
no; just you go up and ask first if she can find room for me.&nbsp;
I have to see one or two persons on another matter.&nbsp; You will find
me down at the carrier&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour the lad came back, and said that Mrs. Newberry
would have no objection to accommodate him, whereupon Stockdale called
at the house.</p>
<p>It stood within a garden-hedge, and seemed to be roomy and comfortable.&nbsp;
He saw an elderly woman, with whom he made arrangements to come the
same night, since there was no inn in the place, and he wished to house
himself as soon as possible; the village being a local centre from which
he was to radiate at once to the different small chapels in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
He forthwith sent his luggage to Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s from the carrier&rsquo;s,
where he had taken shelter, and in the evening walked up to his temporary
home.</p>
<p>As he now lived there, Stockdale felt it unnecessary to knock at
the door; and entering quietly he had the pleasure of hearing footsteps
scudding away like mice into the back quarters.&nbsp; He advanced to
the parlour, as the front room was called, though its stone floor was
scarcely disguised by the carpet, which only over-laid the trodden areas,
leaving sandy deserts under the bulging mouldings of the table-legs,
playing with brass furniture.&nbsp; But the room looked snug and cheerful.&nbsp;
The firelight shone out brightly, trembling on the knobs and handles,
and lurking in great strength on the under surface of the chimney-piece.&nbsp;
A deep arm-chair, covered with horsehair, and studded with a countless
throng of brass nails, was pulled up on one side of the fireplace.&nbsp;
The tea-things were on the table, the teapot cover was open, and a little
hand-bell had been laid at that precise point towards which a person
seated in the great chair might be expected instinctively to stretch
his hand.</p>
<p>Stockdale sat down, not objecting to his experience of the room thus
far, and began his residence by tinkling the bell.&nbsp; A little girl
crept in at the summons, and made tea for him.&nbsp; Her name, she said,
was Marther Sarer, and she lived out there, nodding towards the road
and village generally.&nbsp; Before Stockdale had got far with his meal,
a tap sounded on the door behind him, and on his telling the inquirer
to come in, a rustle of garments caused him to turn his head.&nbsp;
He saw before him a fine and extremely well-made young woman, with dark
hair, a wide, sensible, beautiful forehead, eyes that warmed him before
he knew it, and a mouth that was in itself a picture to all appreciative
souls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I get you anything else for tea?&rsquo; she said, coming
forward a step or two, an expression of liveliness on her features,
and her hand waving the door by its edge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, thank you,&rsquo; said Stockdale, thinking less of
what he replied than of what might be her relation to the household.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite sure?&rsquo; said the young woman, apparently
aware that he had not considered his answer.</p>
<p>He conscientiously examined the tea-things, and found them all there.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Quite sure, Miss Newberry,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Mrs. Newberry,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lizzy Newberry,
I used to be Lizzy Simpkins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Newberry.&rsquo;&nbsp; And before
he had occasion to say more she left the room.</p>
<p>Stockdale remained in some doubt till Martha Sarah came to clear
the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whose house is this, my little woman,&rsquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Lizzy Newberry&rsquo;s, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Mrs. Newberry is not the old lady I saw this afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
It was Mrs. Newberry who comed in to you just by now, because she wanted
to see if you was good-looking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later in the evening, when Stockdale was about to begin supper, she
came again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have come myself, Mr. Stockdale,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; The minister stood up in acknowledgment of the honour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am afraid little Marther might not make you understand.&nbsp;
What will you have for supper?&mdash;there&rsquo;s cold rabbit, and
there&rsquo;s a ham uncut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale said he could get on nicely with those viands, and supper
was laid.&nbsp; He had no more than cut a slice when tap-tap came to
the door again.&nbsp; The minister had already learnt that this particular
rhythm in taps denoted the fingers of his enkindling landlady, and the
doomed young fellow buried his first mouthful under a look of receptive
blandness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have a chicken in the house, Mr. Stockdale&mdash;I quite
forgot to mention it just now.&nbsp; Perhaps you would like Marther
Sarer to bring it up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale had advanced far enough in the art of being a young man
to say that he did not want the chicken, unless she brought it up herself;
but when it was uttered he blushed at the daring gallantry of the speech,
perhaps a shade too strong for a serious man and a minister.&nbsp; In
three minutes the chicken appeared, but, to his great surprise, only
in the hands of Martha Sarah.&nbsp; Stockdale was disappointed, which
perhaps it was intended that he should be.</p>
<p>He had finished supper, and was not in the least anticipating Mrs.
Newberry again that night, when she tapped and entered as before.&nbsp;
Stockdale&rsquo;s gratified look told that she had lost nothing by not
appearing when expected.&nbsp; It happened that the cold in the head
from which the young man suffered had increased with the approach of
night, and before she had spoken he was seized with a violent fit of
sneezing which he could not anyhow repress.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newberry looked full of pity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your cold is very
bad to-night, Mr. Stockdale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale replied that it was rather troublesome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve a good mind&rsquo;&mdash;she added archly,
looking at the cheerless glass of water on the table, which the abstemious
minister was going to drink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mrs. Newberry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind that you should have something more
likely to cure it than that cold stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Stockdale, looking down at the glass, &lsquo;as
there is no inn here, and nothing better to be got in the village, of
course it will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this she replied, &lsquo;There is something better, not far off,
though not in the house.&nbsp; I really think you must try it, or you
may be ill.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Stockdale, you shall.&rsquo;&nbsp; She held
up her finger, seeing that he was about to speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
ask what it is; wait, and you shall see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy went away, and Stockdale waited in a pleasant mood.&nbsp; Presently
she returned with her bonnet and cloak on, saying, &lsquo;I am so sorry,
but you must help me to get it.&nbsp; Mother has gone to bed.&nbsp;
Will you wrap yourself up, and come this way, and please bring that
cup with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale, a lonely young fellow, who had for weeks felt a great
craving for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest, and
even tenderness, was not sorry to join her; and followed his guide through
the back door, across the garden, to the bottom, where the boundary
was a wall.&nbsp; This wall was low, and beyond it Stockdale discerned
in the night shades several grey headstones, and the outlines of the
church roof and tower.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is easy to get up this way,&rsquo; she said, stepping upon
a bank which abutted on the wall; then putting her foot on the top of
the stonework, and descending a spring inside, where the ground was
much higher, as is the manner of graveyards to be.&nbsp; Stockdale did
the same, and followed her in the dusk across the irregular ground till
they came to the tower door, which, when they had entered, she softly
closed behind them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can keep a secret?&rsquo; she said, in a musical voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like an iron chest!&rsquo; said he fervently.</p>
<p>Then from under her cloak she produced a small lighted lantern, which
the minister had not noticed that she carried at all.&nbsp; The light
showed them to be close to the singing-gallery stairs, under which lay
a heap of lumber of all sorts, but consisting mostly of decayed framework,
pews, panels, and pieces of flooring, that from time to time had been
removed from their original fixings in the body of the edifice and replaced
by new.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will drag some of those boards aside?&rsquo; she
said, holding the lantern over her head to light him better.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or
will you take the lantern while I move them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can manage it,&rsquo; said the young man, and acting as
she ordered, he uncovered, to his surprise, a row of little barrels
bound with wood hoops, each barrel being about as large as the nave
of a heavy waggon-wheel.</p>
<p>When they were laid open Lizzy fixed her eyes on him, as if she wondered
what he would say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what they are?&rsquo; she asked, finding that he
did not speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, barrels,&rsquo; said Stockdale simply.&nbsp; He was an
inland man, the son of highly respectable parents, and brought up with
a single eye to the ministry; and the sight suggested nothing beyond
the fact that such articles were there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite right, they are barrels,&rsquo; she said, in
an emphatic tone of candour that was not without a touch of irony.</p>
<p>Stockdale looked at her with an eye of sudden misgiving.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not
smugglers&rsquo; liquor?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are tubs of spirit
that have accidentally come over in the dark from France.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Nether-Moynton and its vicinity at this date people always smiled
at the sort of sin called in the outside world illicit trading; and
these little kegs of gin and brandy were as well known to the inhabitants
as turnips.&nbsp; So that Stockdale&rsquo;s innocent ignorance, and
his look of alarm when he guessed the sinister mystery, seemed to strike
Lizzy first as ludicrous, and then as very awkward for the good impression
that she wished to produce upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smuggling is carried on here by some of the people,&rsquo;
she said in a gentle, apologetic voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;It has been their
practice for generations, and they think it no harm.&nbsp; Now, will
you roll out one of the tubs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What to do with it?&rsquo; said the minister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To draw a little from it to cure your cold,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is so &lsquo;nation strong that it drives away that sort of
thing in a jiffy.&nbsp; O, it is all right about our taking it.&nbsp;
I may have what I like; the owner of the tubs says so.&nbsp; I ought
to have had some in the house, and then I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
been put to this trouble; but I drink none myself, and so I often forget
to keep it indoors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are allowed to help yourself, I suppose, that you may
not inform where their hiding-place is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no; not that particularly; but I may take any if I want
it.&nbsp; So help yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, to oblige you, since you have a right to it,&rsquo;
murmured the minister; and though he was not quite satisfied with his
part in the performance, he rolled one of the &lsquo;tubs&rsquo; out
from the corner into the middle of the tower floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
do you wish me to get it out&mdash;with a gimlet, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rsquo; said his interesting companion;
and she held up with her other hand a shoemaker&rsquo;s awl and a hammer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You must never do these things with a gimlet, because the wood-dust
gets in; and when the buyers pour out the brandy that would tell them
that the tub had been broached.&nbsp; An awl makes no dust, and the
hole nearly closes up again.&nbsp; Now tap one of the hoops forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale took the hammer and did so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now make the hole in the part that was covered by the hoop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made the hole as directed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t run out,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes it will,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take the tub
between your knees, and squeeze the heads; and I&rsquo;ll hold the cup.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale obeyed; and the pressure taking effect upon the tub, which
seemed, to be thin, the spirit spirted out in a stream.&nbsp; When the
cup was full he ceased pressing, and the flow immediately stopped.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now we must fill up the keg with water,&rsquo; said Lizzy, &lsquo;or
it will cluck like forty hens when it is handled, and show that &rsquo;tis
not full.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they tell you you may take it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the <i>smugglers</i>: but the <i>buyers</i> must not
know that the smugglers have been kind to me at their expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Stockdale doubtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I much
question the honesty of this proceeding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By her direction he held the tub with the hole upwards, and while
he went through the process of alternately pressing and ceasing to press,
she produced a bottle of water, from which she took mouthfuls, conveying
each to the keg by putting her pretty lips to the hole, where it was
sucked in at each recovery of the cask from pressure.&nbsp; When it
was again full he plugged the hole, knocked the hoop down to its place,
and buried the tub in the lumber as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t the smugglers afraid that you will tell?&rsquo;
he asked, as they recrossed the churchyard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; they are not afraid of that.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
do such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have put you into a very awkward corner,&rsquo; said
Stockdale emphatically.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must, of course, as an honest
person, sometimes feel that it is your duty to inform&mdash;really you
must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have never particularly felt it as a duty; and, besides,
my first husband&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She stopped, and there was some
confusion in her voice.&nbsp; Stockdale was so honest and unsophisticated
that he did not at once discern why she paused: but at last he did perceive
that the words were a slip, and that no woman would have uttered &lsquo;first
husband&rsquo; by accident unless she had thought pretty frequently
of a second.&nbsp; He felt for her confusion, and allowed her time to
recover and proceed.&nbsp; &lsquo;My husband,&rsquo; she said, in a
self-corrected tone, &lsquo;used to know of their doings, and so did
my father, and kept the secret.&nbsp; I cannot inform, in fact, against
anybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see the hardness of it,&rsquo; he continued, like a man
who looked far into the moral of things.&nbsp; &lsquo;And it is very
cruel that you should be tossed and tantalized between your memories
and your conscience.&nbsp; I do hope, Mrs. Newberry, that you will soon
see your way out of this unpleasant position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t just now,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>By this time they had passed over the wall and entered the house,
where she brought him a glass and hot water, and left him to his own
reflections.&nbsp; He looked after her vanishing form, asking himself
whether he, as a respectable man, and a minister, and a shining light,
even though as yet only of the halfpenny-candle sort, were quite justified
in doing this thing.&nbsp; A sneeze settled the question; and he found
that when the fiery liquor was lowered by the addition of twice or thrice
the quantity of water, it was one of the prettiest cures for a cold
in the head that he had ever known, particularly at this chilly time
of the year.</p>
<p>Stockdale sat in the deep chair about twenty minutes sipping and
meditating, till he at length took warmer views of things, and longed
for the morrow, when he would see Mrs. Newberry again.&nbsp; He then
felt that, though chronologically at a short distance, it would in an
emotional sense be very long before to-morrow came, and walked restlessly
round the room.&nbsp; His eye was attracted by a framed and glazed sampler
in which a running ornament of fir-trees and peacocks surrounded the
following pretty bit of sentiment:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Rose-leaves smell when roses thrive,<br />
Here&rsquo;s my work while I&rsquo;m alive;<br />
Rose-leaves smell when shrunk and shed,<br />
Here&rsquo;s my work when I am dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lizzy Simpkins.&nbsp; Fear God.&nbsp; Honour the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aged 11 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hers,&rsquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heavens,
how I like that name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before he had done thinking that no other name from Abigail to Zenobia
would have suited his young landlady so well, tap-tap came again upon
the door; and the minister started as her face appeared yet another
time, looking so disinterested that the most ingenious would have refrained
from asserting that she had come to affect his feelings by her seductive
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like a fire in your room, Mr. Stockdale, on account
of your cold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The minister, being still a little pricked in the conscience for
countenancing her in watering the spirits, saw here a way to self-chastisement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, I thank you,&rsquo; he said firmly; &lsquo;it is not necessary.&nbsp;
I have never been used to one in my life, and it would be giving way
to luxury too far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t insist,&rsquo; she said, and disconcerted
him by vanishing instantly.</p>
<p>Wondering if she was vexed by his refusal, he wished that he had
chosen to have a fire, even though it should have scorched him out of
bed and endangered his self-discipline for a dozen days.&nbsp; However,
he consoled himself with what was in truth a rare consolation for a
budding lover, that he was under the same roof with Lizzy; her guest,
in fact, to take a poetical view of the term lodger; and that he would
certainly see her on the morrow.</p>
<p>The morrow came, and Stockdale rose early, his cold quite gone.&nbsp;
He had never in his life so longed for the breakfast hour as he did
that day, and punctually at eight o&rsquo;clock, after a short walk,
to reconnoitre the premises, he re-entered the door of his dwelling.&nbsp;
Breakfast passed, and Martha Sarah attended, but nobody came voluntarily
as on the night before to inquire if there were other wants which he
had not mentioned, and which she would attempt to gratify.&nbsp; He
was disappointed, and went out, hoping to see her at dinner.&nbsp; Dinner
time came; he sat down to the meal, finished it, lingered on for a whole
hour, although two new teachers were at that moment waiting at the chapel-door
to speak to him by appointment.&nbsp; It was useless to wait longer,
and he slowly went his way down the lane, cheered by the thought that,
after all, he would see her in the evening, and perhaps engage again
in the delightful tub-broaching in the neighbouring church tower, which
proceeding he resolved to render more moral by steadfastly insisting
that no water should be introduced to fill up, though the tub should
cluck like all the hens in Christendom.&nbsp; But nothing could disguise
the fact that it was a queer business; and his countenance fell when
he thought how much more his mind was interested in that matter than
in his serious duties.</p>
<p>However, compunction vanished with the decline of day.&nbsp; Night
came, and his tea and supper; but no Lizzy Newberry, and no sweet temptations.&nbsp;
At last the minister could bear it no longer, and said to his quaint
little attendant, &lsquo;Where is Mrs. Newberry to-day?&rsquo; judiciously
handing a penny as he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s busy,&rsquo; said Martha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything serious happened?&rsquo; he asked, handing another
penny, and revealing yet additional pennies in the background.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;nothing at all!&rsquo; said she, with breathless
confidence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing ever happens to her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
only biding upstairs in bed because &rsquo;tis her way sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being a young man of some honour, he would not question further,
and assuming that Lizzy must have a bad headache, or other slight ailment,
in spite of what the girl had said, he went to bed dissatisfied, not
even setting eyes on old Mrs. Simpkins.&nbsp; &lsquo;I said last night
that I should see her to-morrow,&rsquo; he reflected; &lsquo;but that
was not to be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day he had better fortune, or worse, meeting her at the foot
of the stairs in the morning, and being favoured by a visit or two from
her during the day&mdash;once for the purpose of making kindly inquiries
about his comfort, as on the first evening, and at another time to place
a bunch of winter-violets on his table, with a promise to renew them
when they drooped.&nbsp; On these occasions there was something in her
smile which showed how conscious she was of the effect she produced,
though it must be said that it was rather a humorous than a designing
consciousness, and savoured more of pride than of vanity.</p>
<p>As for Stockdale, he clearly perceived that he possessed unlimited
capacity for backsliding, and wished that tutelary saints were not denied
to Dissenters.&nbsp; He set a watch upon his tongue and eyes for the
space of one hour and a half, after which he found it was useless to
struggle further, and gave himself up to the situation.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
other minister will be here in a month,&rsquo; he said to himself when
sitting over the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I shall be off, and she will
distract my mind no more! . . . And then, shall I go on living by myself
for ever?&nbsp; No; when my two years of probation are finished, I shall
have a furnished house to live in, with a varnished door and a brass
knocker; and I&rsquo;ll march straight back to her, and ask her flat,
as soon as the last plate is on the dresser!</p>
<p>Thus a titillating fortnight was passed by young Stockdale, during
which time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever since
the beginning of history.&nbsp; He saw the object of attachment several
times one day, did not see her at all the next, met her when he least
expected to do so, missed her when hints and signs as to where she should
be at a given hour almost amounted to an appointment.&nbsp; This mild
coquetry was perhaps fair enough under the circumstances of their being
so closely lodged, and Stockdale put up with it as philosophically as
he was able.&nbsp; Being in her own house, she could, after vexing him
or disappointing him of her presence, easily win him back by suddenly
surrounding him with those little attentions which her position as his
landlady put it in her power to bestow.&nbsp; When he had waited indoors
half the day to see her, and on finding that she would not be seen,
had gone off in a huff to the dreariest and dampest walk he could discover,
she would restore equilibrium in the evening with &lsquo;Mr. Stockdale,
I have fancied you must feel draught o&rsquo; nights from your bedroom
window, and so I have been putting up thicker curtains this afternoon
while you were out;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;I noticed that you sneezed twice
again this morning, Mr. Stockdale.&nbsp; Depend upon it that cold is
hanging about you yet; I am sure it is&mdash;I have thought of it continually;
and you must let me make a posset for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes in coming home he found his sitting-room rearranged, chairs
placed where the table had stood, and the table ornamented with the
few fresh flowers and leaves that could be obtained at this season,
so as to add a novelty to the room.&nbsp; At times she would be standing
on a chair outside the house, trying to nail up a branch of the monthly
rose which the winter wind had blown down; and of course he stepped
forward to assist her, when their hands got mixed in passing the shreds
and nails.&nbsp; Thus they became friends again after a disagreement.&nbsp;
She would utter on these occasions some pretty and deprecatory remark
on the necessity of her troubling him anew; and he would straightway
say that he would do a hundred times as much for her if she should so
require.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;HOW HE SAW TWO OTHER MEN</h3>
<p>Matters being in this advancing state, Stockdale was rather surprised
one cloudy evening, while sitting in his room, at hearing her speak
in low tones of expostulation to some one at the door.&nbsp; It was
nearly dark, but the shutters were not yet closed, nor the candles lighted;
and Stockdale was tempted to stretch his head towards the window.&nbsp;
He saw outside the door a young man in clothes of a whitish colour,
and upon reflection judged their wearer to be the well-built and rather
handsome miller who lived below.&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s voice was
alternately low and firm, and sometimes it reached the level of positive
entreaty; but what the words were Stockdale could in no way hear.</p>
<p>Before the colloquy had ended, the minister&rsquo;s attention was
attracted by a second incident.&nbsp; Opposite Lizzy&rsquo;s home grew
a clump of laurels, forming a thick and permanent shade.&nbsp; One of
the laurel boughs now quivered against the light background of sky,
and in a moment the head of a man peered out, and remained still.&nbsp;
He seemed to be also much interested in the conversation at the door,
and was plainly lingering there to watch and listen.&nbsp; Had Stockdale
stood in any other relation to Lizzy than that of a lover, he might
have gone out and investigated the meaning of this: but being as yet
but an unprivileged ally, he did nothing more than stand up and show
himself against the firelight, whereupon the listener disappeared, and
Lizzy and the miller spoke in lower tones.</p>
<p>Stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance, that as soon as
the miller was gone, he said, &lsquo;Mrs. Newberry, are you aware that
you were watched just now, and your conversation heard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you were talking to that miller.&nbsp; A man was looking
from the laurel-tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand,
and he added, &lsquo;Perhaps you were talking of things you did not
wish to be overheard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was talking only on business,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lizzy, be frank!&rsquo; said the young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
it was only on business, why should anybody wish to listen to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked curiously at him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What else do you think
it could be, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;the only talk between a young woman and man that
is likely to amuse an eavesdropper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah yes,&rsquo; she said, smiling in spite of her preoccupation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, my cousin Owlett has spoken to me about matrimony, every
now and then, that&rsquo;s true; but he was not speaking of it then.&nbsp;
I wish he had been speaking of it, with all my heart.&nbsp; It would
have been much less serious for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Mrs. Newberry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would.&nbsp; Not that I should ha&rsquo; chimed in with
him, of course.&nbsp; I wish it for other reasons.&nbsp; I am glad,
Mr. Stockdale, that you have told me of that listener.&nbsp; It is a
timely warning, and I must see my cousin again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t go away till I have spoken,&rsquo; said the
minister.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll out with it at once, and make no more
ado.&nbsp; Let it be Yes or No between us, Lizzy; please do!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he held out his hand, in which she freely allowed her own to rest,
but without speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean Yes by that?&rsquo; he asked, after waiting a while.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be my sweetheart, if you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not say at once you will wait for me until I have a house
and can come back to marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I am thinking&mdash;thinking of something else,&rsquo;
she said with embarrassment.&nbsp; &lsquo;It all comes upon me at once,
and I must settle one thing at a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, dear Lizzy, you can assure me that the miller
shall not be allowed to speak to you except on business? You have never
directly encouraged him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She parried the question by saying, &lsquo;You see, he and his party
have been in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes, and
as I have not denied him, it makes him rather forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Things&mdash;what things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tubs&mdash;they are called Things here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why don&rsquo;t you deny him, my dear Lizzy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are too timid.&nbsp; It is unfair of him to impose so
upon you, and get your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks.&nbsp;
Promise me that the next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will
let me roll them into the street?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would not venture to offend the
neighbours so much as that,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;or do anything that
would be so likely to put poor Owlett into the hands of the excisemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale sighed, and said that he thought hers a mistaken generosity
when it extended to assisting those who cheated the king of his dues.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At any rate, you will let me make him keep his distance as your
lover, and tell him flatly that you are not for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please not, at present,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
wish to offend my old neighbours.&nbsp; It is not only Owlett who is
concerned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is too bad,&rsquo; said Stockdale impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my honour, I won&rsquo;t encourage him as my lover,&rsquo;
Lizzy answered earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;A reasonable man will be satisfied
with that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, so I am,&rsquo; said Stockdale, his countenance clearing.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE MYSTERIOUS GREATCOAT</h3>
<p>Stockdale now began to notice more particularly a feature in the
life of his fair landlady, which he had casually observed but scarcely
ever thought of before.&nbsp; It was that she was markedly irregular
in her hours of rising.&nbsp; For a week or two she would be tolerably
punctual, reaching the ground-floor within a few minutes of half-past
seven.&nbsp; Then suddenly she would not be visible till twelve at noon,
perhaps for three or four days in succession; and twice he had certain
proof that she did not leave her room till half-past three in the afternoon.&nbsp;
The second time that this extreme lateness came under his notice was
on a day when he had particularly wished to consult with her about his
future movements; and he concluded, as he always had done, that she
had a cold, headache, or other ailment, unless she had kept herself
invisible to avoid meeting and talking to him, which he could hardly
believe.&nbsp; The former supposition was disproved, however, by her
innocently saying, some days later, when they were speaking on a question
of health, that she had never had a moment&rsquo;s heaviness, headache,
or illness of any kind since the previous January twelvemonth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought
quite otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, do I look sickly?&rsquo; she asked, turning up her face
to show the impossibility of his gazing on it and holding such a belief
for a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all; I merely thought so from your being sometimes
obliged to keep your room through the best part of the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, as for that&mdash;it means nothing,&rsquo; she murmured,
with a look which some might have called cold, and which was the worst
look that he liked to see upon her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is pure sleepiness,
Mr. Stockdale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, I tell you.&nbsp; When I stay in my room till half-past
three in the afternoon, you may always be sure that I slept soundly
till three, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have stayed there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is dreadful,&rsquo; said Stockdale, thinking of the disastrous
effects of such indulgence upon the household of a minister, should
it become a habit of everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But then,&rsquo; she said, divining his good and prescient
thoughts, &lsquo;it only happens when I stay awake all night.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t go to sleep till five or six in the morning sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s another matter,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sleeplessness to such an alarming extent is real illness.&nbsp;
Have you spoken to a doctor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;there is no need for doing that&mdash;it is all
natural to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she went away without further remark.</p>
<p>Stockdale might have waited a long time to know the real cause of
her sleeplessness, had it not happened that one dark night he was sitting
in his bedroom jotting down notes for a sermon, which occupied him perfunctorily
for a considerable time after the other members of the household had
retired.&nbsp; He did not get to bed till one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Before
he had fallen asleep he heard a knocking at the front door, first rather
timidly performed, and then louder.&nbsp; Nobody answered it, and the
person knocked again.&nbsp; As the house still remained undisturbed,
Stockdale got out of bed, went to his window, which overlooked the door,
and opening it, asked who was there.</p>
<p>A young woman&rsquo;s voice replied that Susan Wallis was there,
and that she had come to ask if Mrs. Newberry could give her some mustard
to make a plaster with, as her father was taken very ill on the chest.</p>
<p>The minister, having neither bell nor servant, was compelled to act
in person.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will call Mrs. Newberry,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
Partly dressing himself; he went along the passage and tapped at Lizzy&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; She did not answer, and, thinking of her erratic habits
in the matter of sleep, he thumped the door persistently, when he discovered,
by its moving ajar under his knocking, that it had only been gently
pushed to.&nbsp; As there was now a sufficient entry for the voice,
he knocked no longer, but said in firm tones, &lsquo;Mrs. Newberry,
you are wanted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The room was quite silent; not a breathing, not a rustle, came from
any part of it.&nbsp; Stockdale now sent a positive shout through the
open space of the door: &lsquo;Mrs. Newberry!&rsquo;&mdash;still no
answer, or movement of any kind within.&nbsp; Then he heard sounds from
the opposite room, that of Lizzy&rsquo;s mother, as if she had been
aroused by his uproar though Lizzy had not, and was dressing herself
hastily.&nbsp; Stockdale softly closed the younger woman&rsquo;s door
and went on to the other, which was opened by Mrs. Simpkins before he
could reach it.&nbsp; She was in her ordinary clothes, and had a light
in her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the person calling about?&rsquo; she said in
alarm.</p>
<p>Stockdale told the girl&rsquo;s errand, adding seriously, &lsquo;I
cannot wake Mrs. Newberry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no matter,&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can
let the girl have what she wants as well as my daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And she came out of the room and went downstairs.</p>
<p>Stockdale retired towards his own apartment, saying, however, to
Mrs. Simpkins from the landing, as if on second thoughts, &lsquo;I suppose
there is nothing the matter with Mrs. Newberry, that I could not wake
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said the old lady hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing
at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still the minister was not satisfied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you go in
and see?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should be much more at ease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Simpkins returned up the staircase, went to her daughter&rsquo;s
room, and came out again almost instantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is nothing
at all the matter with Lizzy,&rsquo; she said; and descended again to
attend to the applicant, who, having seen the light, had remained quiet
during this interval.</p>
<p>Stockdale went into his room and lay down as before.&nbsp; He heard
Lizzy&rsquo;s mother open the front door, admit the girl, and then the
murmured discourse of both as they went to the store-cupboard for the
medicament required.&nbsp; The girl departed, the door was fastened,
Mrs. Simpkins came upstairs, and the house was again in silence.&nbsp;
Still the minister did not fall asleep.&nbsp; He could not get rid of
a singular suspicion, which was all the more harassing in being, if
true, the most unaccountable thing within his experience.&nbsp; That
Lizzy Newberry was in her bedroom when he made such a clamour at the
door he could not possibly convince himself; notwithstanding that he
had heard her come upstairs at the usual time, go into her chamber,
and shut herself up in the usual way.&nbsp; Yet all reason was so much
against her being elsewhere, that he was constrained to go back again
to the unlikely theory of a heavy sleep, though he had heard neither
breath nor movement during a shouting and knocking loud enough to rouse
the Seven Sleepers.</p>
<p>Before coming to any positive conclusion he fell asleep himself,
and did not awake till day.&nbsp; He saw nothing of Mrs. Newberry in
the morning, before he went out to meet the rising sun, as he liked
to do when the weather was fine; but as this was by no means unusual,
he took no notice of it.&nbsp; At breakfast-time he knew that she was
not far off by hearing her in the kitchen, and though he saw nothing
of her person, that back apartment being rigorously closed against his
eyes, she seemed to be talking, ordering, and bustling about among the
pots and skimmers in so ordinary a manner, that there was no reason
for his wasting more time in fruitless surmise.</p>
<p>The minister suffered from these distractions, and his extemporized
sermons were not improved thereby.&nbsp; Already he often said Romans
for Corinthians in the pulpit, and gave out hymns in strange cramped
metres, that hitherto had always been skipped, because the congregation
could not raise a tune to fit them.&nbsp; He fully resolved that as
soon as his few weeks of stay approached their end he would cut the
matter short, and commit himself by proposing a definite engagement,
repenting at leisure if necessary.</p>
<p>With this end in view, he suggested to her on the evening after her
mysterious sleep that they should take a walk together just before dark,
the latter part of the proposition being introduced that they might
return home unseen.&nbsp; She consented to go; and away they went over
a stile, to a shrouded footpath suited for the occasion.&nbsp; But,
in spite of attempts on both sides, they were unable to infuse much
spirit into the ramble.&nbsp; She looked rather paler than usual, and
sometimes turned her head away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lizzy,&rsquo; said Stockdale reproachfully, when they had
walked in silence a long distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You yawned&mdash;much my company is to you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
put it in that way, but he was really wondering whether her yawn could
possibly have more to do with physical weariness from the night before
than mental weariness of that present moment.&nbsp; Lizzy apologized,
and owned that she was rather tired, which gave him an opening for a
direct question on the point; but his modesty would not allow him to
put it to her; and he uncomfortably resolved to wait.</p>
<p>The month of February passed with alternations of mud and frost,
rain and sleet, east winds and north-westerly gales.&nbsp; The hollow
places in the ploughed fields showed themselves as pools of water, which
had settled there from the higher levels, and had not yet found time
to soak away.&nbsp; The birds began to get lively, and a single thrush
came just before sunset each evening, and sang hopefully on the large
elm-tree which stood nearest to Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Cold
blasts and brittle earth had given place to an oozing dampness more
unpleasant in itself than frost; but it suggested coming spring, and
its unpleasantness was of a bearable kind.</p>
<p>Stockdale had been going to bring about a practical understanding
with Lizzy at least half-a-dozen times; but, what with the mystery of
her apparent absence on the night of the neighbour&rsquo;s call, and
her curious way of lying in bed at unaccountable times, he felt a check
within him whenever he wanted to speak out.&nbsp; Thus they still lived
on as indefinitely affianced lovers, each of whom hardly acknowledged
the other&rsquo;s claim to the name of chosen one.&nbsp; Stockdale persuaded
himself that his hesitation was owing to the postponement of the ordained
minister&rsquo;s arrival, and the consequent delay in his own departure,
which did away with all necessity for haste in his courtship; but perhaps
it was only that his discretion was reasserting itself, and telling
him that he had better get clearer ideas of Lizzy before arranging for
the grand contract of his life with her.&nbsp; She, on her part, always
seemed ready to be urged further on that question than he had hitherto
attempted to go; but she was none the less independent, and to a degree
which would have kept from flagging the passion of a far more mutable
man.</p>
<p>On the evening of the first of March he went casually into his bedroom
about dusk, and noticed lying on a chair a greatcoat, hat, and breeches.&nbsp;
Having no recollection of leaving any clothes of his own in that spot,
he went and examined them as well as he could in the twilight, and found
that they did not belong to him.&nbsp; He paused for a moment to consider
how they might have got there.&nbsp; He was the only man living in the
house; and yet these were not his garments, unless he had made a mistake.&nbsp;
No, they were not his.&nbsp; He called up Martha Sarah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did these things come in my room?&rsquo; he said, flinging
the objectionable articles to the floor.</p>
<p>Martha said that Mrs. Newberry had given them to her to brush, and
that she had brought them up there thinking they must be Mr. Stockdale&rsquo;s,
as there was no other gentleman a-lodging there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you did,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
take them down to your mis&rsquo;ess, and say they are some clothes
I have found here and know nothing about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the door was left open he heard the conversation downstairs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How stupid!&rsquo; said Mrs. Newberry, in a tone of confusion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, Marther Sarer, I did not tell you to take &rsquo;em to Mr.
Stockdale&rsquo;s room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought they must be his as they was so muddy,&rsquo; said
Martha humbly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have left &rsquo;em on the clothes-horse,&rsquo;
said the young mistress severely; and she came upstairs with the garments
on her arm, quickly passed Stockdale&rsquo;s room, and threw them forcibly
into a closet at the end of a passage.&nbsp; With this the incident
ended, and the house was silent again.</p>
<p>There would have been nothing remarkable in finding such clothes
in a widow&rsquo;s house had they been clean; or moth-eaten, or creased,
or mouldy from long lying by; but that they should be splashed with
recent mud bothered Stockdale a good deal.&nbsp; When a young pastor
is in the aspen stage of attachment, and open to agitation at the merest
trifles, a really substantial incongruity of this complexion is a disturbing
thing.&nbsp; However, nothing further occurred at that time; but he
became watchful, and given to conjecture, and was unable to forget the
circumstance.</p>
<p>One morning, on looking from his window, he saw Mrs. Newberry herself
brushing the tails of a long drab greatcoat, which, if he mistook not,
was the very same garment as the one that had adorned the chair of his
room.&nbsp; It was densely splashed up to the hollow of the back with
neighbouring Nether-Moynton mud, to judge by its colour, the spots being
distinctly visible to him in the sunlight.&nbsp; The previous day or
two having been wet, the inference was irresistible that the wearer
had quite recently been walking some considerable distance about the
lanes and fields.&nbsp; Stockdale opened the window and looked out,
and Mrs. Newberry turned her head.&nbsp; Her face became slowly red;
she never had looked prettier, or more incomprehensible, he waved his
hand affectionately, and said good-morning; she answered with embarrassment,
having ceased her occupation on the instant that she saw him, and rolled
up the coat half-cleaned.</p>
<p>Stockdale shut the window.&nbsp; Some simple explanation of her proceeding
was doubtless within the bounds of possibility; but he himself could
not think of one; and he wished that she had placed the matter beyond
conjecture by voluntarily saying something about it there and then.</p>
<p>But, though Lizzy had not offered an explanation at the moment, the
subject was brought forward by her at the next time of their meeting.&nbsp;
She was chatting to him concerning some other event, and remarked that
it happened about the time when she was dusting some old clothes that
had belonged to her poor husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You keep them clean out of respect to his memory?&rsquo; said
Stockdale tentatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I air and dust them sometimes,&rsquo; she said, with the most
charming innocence in the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do dead men come out of their graves and walk in mud?&rsquo;
murmured the minister, in a cold sweat at the deception that she was
practising.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; asked Lizzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, nothing,&rsquo; said he mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mere
words&mdash;a phrase that will do for my sermon next Sunday.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was too plain that Lizzy was unaware that he had seen actual pedestrian
splashes upon the skirts of the tell-tale overcoat, and that she imagined
him to believe it had come direct from some chest or drawer.</p>
<p>The aspect of the case was now considerably darker.&nbsp; Stockdale
was so much depressed by it that he did not challenge her explanation,
or threaten to go off as a missionary to benighted islanders, or reproach
her in any way whatever.&nbsp; He simply parted from her when she had
done talking, and lived on in perplexity, till by degrees his natural
manner became sad and constrained.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;AT THE TIME OF THE NEW MOON</h3>
<p>The following Thursday was changeable, damp, and gloomy; and the
night threatened to be windy and unpleasant.&nbsp; Stockdale had gone
away to Knollsea in the morning, to be present at some commemoration
service there, and on his return he was met by the attractive Lizzy
in the passage.&nbsp; Whether influenced by the tide of cheerfulness
which had attended him that day, or by the drive through the open air,
or whether from a natural disposition to let bygones alone, he allowed
himself to be fascinated into forgetfulness of the greatcoat incident,
and upon the whole passed a pleasant evening; not so much in her society
as within sound of her voice, as she sat talking in the back parlour
to her mother, till the latter went to bed.&nbsp; Shortly after this
Mrs. Newberry retired, and then Stockdale prepared to go upstairs himself.&nbsp;
But before he left the room he remained standing by the dying embers
awhile, thinking long of one thing and another; and was only aroused
by the flickering of his candle in the socket as it suddenly declined
and went out.&nbsp; Knowing that there were a tinder-box, matches, and
another candle in his bedroom, he felt his way upstairs without a light.&nbsp;
On reaching his chamber he laid his hand on every possible ledge and
corner for the tinderbox, but for a long time in vain.&nbsp; Discovering
it at length, Stockdale produced a spark, and was kindling the brimstone,
when he fancied that he heard a movement in the passage.&nbsp; He blew
harder at the lint, the match flared up, and looking by aid of the blue
light through the door, which had been standing open all this time,
he was surprised to see a male figure vanishing round the top of the
staircase with the evident intention of escaping unobserved.&nbsp; The
personage wore the clothes which Lizzy had been brushing, and something
in the outline and gait suggested to the minister that the wearer was
Lizzy herself.</p>
<p>But he was not sure of this; and, greatly excited, Stockdale determined
to investigate the mystery, and to adopt his own way for doing it.&nbsp;
He blew out the match without lighting the candle, went into the passage,
and proceeded on tiptoe towards Lizzy&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; A faint grey
square of light in the direction of the chamber-window as he approached
told him that the door was open, and at once suggested that the occupant
was gone.&nbsp; He turned and brought down his fist upon the handrail
of the staircase: &lsquo;It was she; in her late husband&rsquo;s coat
and hat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat relieved to find that there was no intruder in the case,
yet none the less surprised, the minister crept down the stairs, softly
put on his boots, overcoat, and hat, and tried the front door.&nbsp;
It was fastened as usual: he went to the back door, found this unlocked,
and emerged into the garden.&nbsp; The night was mild and moonless,
and rain had lately been falling, though for the present it had ceased.&nbsp;
There was a sudden dropping from the trees and bushes every now and
then, as each passing wind shook their boughs.&nbsp; Among these sounds
Stockdale heard the faint fall of feet upon the road outside, and he
guessed from the step that it was Lizzy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He followed the
sound, and, helped by the circumstance of the wind blowing from the
direction in which the pedestrian moved, he got nearly close to her,
and kept there, without risk of being overheard.&nbsp; While he thus
followed her up the street or lane, as it might indifferently be called,
there being more hedge than houses on either side, a figure came forward
to her from one of the cottage doors.&nbsp; Lizzy stopped; the minister
stepped upon the grass and stopped also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that Mrs. Newberry?&rsquo; said the man who had come out,
whose voice Stockdale recognized as that of one of the most devout members
of his congregation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Lizzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be quite ready&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been here this quarter-hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, John,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I have bad news; there is
danger to-night for our venture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And d&rsquo;ye tell o&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I dreamed there might
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said hurriedly; &lsquo;and you must go at
once round to where the chaps are waiting, and tell them they will not
be wanted till to-morrow night at the same time.&nbsp; I go to burn
the lugger off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; he said; and instantly went off through a gate,
Lizzy continuing her way.</p>
<p>On she tripped at a quickening pace till the lane turned into the
turnpike-road, which she crossed, and got into the track for Ringsworth.&nbsp;
Here she ascended the hill without the least hesitation, passed the
lonely hamlet of Holworth, and went down the vale on the other side.&nbsp;
Stockdale had never taken any extensive walks in this direction, but
he was aware that if she persisted in her course much longer she would
draw near to the coast, which was here between two and three miles distant
from Nether-Moynton; and as it had been about a quarter-past eleven
o&rsquo;clock when they set out, her intention seemed to be to reach
the shore about midnight.</p>
<p>Lizzy soon ascended a small mound, which Stockdale at the same time
adroitly skirted on the left; and a dull monotonous roar burst upon
his ear.&nbsp; The hillock was about fifty yards from the top of the
cliffs, and by day it apparently commanded a full view of the bay.&nbsp;
There was light enough in the sky to show her disguised figure against
it when she reached the top, where she paused, and afterwards sat down.&nbsp;
Stockdale, not wishing on any account to alarm her at this moment, yet
desirous of being near her, sank upon his hands and knees, crept a little
higher up, and there stayed still.</p>
<p>The wind was chilly, the ground damp, and his position one in which
he did not care to remain long.&nbsp; However, before he had decided
to leave it, the young man heard voices behind him.&nbsp; What they
signified he did not know; but, fearing that Lizzy was in danger, he
was about to run forward and warn her that she might be seen, when she
crept to the shelter of a little bush which maintained a precarious
existence in that exposed spot; and her form was absorbed in its dark
and stunted outline as if she had become part of it.&nbsp; She had evidently
heard the men as well as he.&nbsp; They passed near him, talking in
loud and careless tones, which could be heard above the uninterrupted
washings of the sea, and which suggested that they were not engaged
in any business at their own risk.&nbsp; This proved to be the fact:
some of their words floated across to him, and caused him to forget
at once the coldness of his situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the vessel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lugger, about fifty tons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Cherbourg, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, &rsquo;a b&rsquo;lieve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it don&rsquo;t all belong to Owlett?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s only got a share.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
another or two in it&mdash;a farmer and such like, but the names I don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voices died away, and the heads and shoulders of the men diminished
towards the cliff, and dropped out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My darling has been tempted to buy a share by that unbeliever
Owlett,&rsquo; groaned the minister, his honest affection for Lizzy
having quickened to its intensest point during these moments of risk
to her person and name.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s here,&rsquo;
he said to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, it will be the ruin of her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His perturbation was interrupted by the sudden bursting out of a
bright and increasing light from the spot where Lizzy was in hiding.&nbsp;
A few seconds later, and before it had reached the height of a blaze,
he heard her rush past him down the hollow like a stone from a sling,
in the direction of home.&nbsp; The light now flared high and wide,
and showed its position clearly.&nbsp; She had kindled a bough of furze
and stuck it into the bush under which she had been crouching; the wind
fanned the flame, which crackled fiercely, and threatened to consume
the bush as well as the bough.&nbsp; Stockdale paused just long enough
to notice thus much, and then followed rapidly the route taken by the
young woman.&nbsp; His intention was to overtake her, and reveal himself
as a friend; but run as he would he could see nothing of her.&nbsp;
Thus he flew across the open country about Holworth, twisting his legs
and ankles in unexpected fissures and descents, till, on coming to the
gate between the downs and the road, he was forced to pause to get breath.&nbsp;
There was no audible movement either in front or behind him, and he
now concluded that she had not outrun him, but that, hearing him at
her heels, and believing him one of the excise party, she had hidden
herself somewhere on the way, and let him pass by.</p>
<p>He went on at a more leisurely pace towards the village.&nbsp; On
reaching the house he found his surmise to be correct, for the gate
was on the latch, and the door unfastened, just as he had left them.&nbsp;
Stockdale closed the door behind him, and waited silently in the passage.&nbsp;
In about ten minutes he heard the same light footstep that he had heard
in going out; it paused at the gate, which opened and shut softly, and
then the door-latch was lifted, and Lizzy came in.</p>
<p>Stockdale went forward and said at once, &lsquo;Lizzy, don&rsquo;t
be frightened.&nbsp; I have been waiting up for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started, though she had recognized the voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is Mr. Stockdale, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, becoming angry now that she was safe
indoors, and not alarmed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And a nice game I&rsquo;ve found
you out in to-night.&nbsp; You are in man&rsquo;s clothes, and I am
ashamed of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy could hardly find a voice to answer this unexpected reproach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only partly in man&rsquo;s clothes,&rsquo; she faltered,
shrinking back to the wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is only his greatcoat and
hat and breeches that I&rsquo;ve got on, which is no harm, as he was
my own husband; and I do it only because a cloak blows about so, and
you can&rsquo;t use your arms.&nbsp; I have got my own dress under just
the same&mdash;it is only tucked in!&nbsp; Will you go away upstairs
and let me pass?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want you to see me at such a time
as this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have a right to see you!&nbsp; How do you think there
can be anything between us now?&rsquo;&nbsp; Lizzy was silent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are a smuggler,&rsquo; he continued sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only a share in the run,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That makes no difference.&nbsp; Whatever did you engage in
such a trade as that for, and keep it such a secret from me all this
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t do it always.&nbsp; I only do it in winter-time
when &rsquo;tis new moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s because it can&rsquo;t be done
anywhen else . . . You have regularly upset me, Lizzy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for that,&rsquo; Lizzy meekly replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well now,&rsquo; said he more tenderly, &lsquo;no harm is
done as yet.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you for the sake of me give up this blamable
and dangerous practice altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must do my best to save this run,&rsquo; said she, getting
rather husky in the throat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give
you up&mdash;you know that; but I don&rsquo;t want to lose my venture.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know what to do now!&nbsp; Why I have kept it so secret
from you is that I was afraid you would be angry if you knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so!&nbsp; I suppose if I had married you without
finding this out you&rsquo;d have gone on with it just the same?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I did not think so far ahead.&nbsp;
I only went to-night to burn the folks off, because we found that the
excisemen knew where the tubs were to be landed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pretty mess to be in altogether, is this,&rsquo; said
the distracted young minister.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, what will you do now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy slowly murmured the particulars of their plan, the chief of
which were that they meant to try their luck at some other point of
the shore the next night; that three landing-places were always agreed
upon before the run was attempted, with the understanding that, if the
vessel was &lsquo;burnt off&rsquo; from the first point, which was Ringsworth,
as it had been by her to-night, the crew should attempt to make the
second, which was Lulstead Cove, on the second night; and if there,
too, danger threatened, they should on the third night try the third
place, which was behind a headland further west.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose the officers hinder them landing there too?&rsquo;
he said, his attention to this interesting programme displacing for
a moment his concern at her share in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we shan&rsquo;t try anywhere else all this dark&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what we call the time between moon and moon&mdash;and perhaps they&rsquo;ll
string the tubs to a stray-line, and sink &rsquo;em a little-ways from
shore, and take the bearings; and then when they have a chance they&rsquo;ll
go to creep for &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, they&rsquo;ll go out in a boat and drag a creeper&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a grapnel&mdash;along the bottom till it catch hold of the stray-line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The minister stood thinking; and there was no sound within doors
but the tick of the clock on the stairs, and the quick breathing of
Lizzy, partly from her walk and partly from agitation, as she stood
close to the wall, not in such complete darkness but that he could discern
against its whitewashed surface the greatcoat and broad hat which covered
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lizzy, all this is very wrong,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
you remember the lesson of the tribute-money?&nbsp; &ldquo;Render unto
Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely you have
heard that read times enough in your growing up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; she pouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the spirit of the text is in force just the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father did it, and so did my grandfather, and almost everybody
in Nether-Moynton lives by it, and life would be so dull if it wasn&rsquo;t
for that, that I should not care to live at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am nothing to live for, of course,&rsquo; he replied bitterly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You would not think it worth while to give up this wild business
and live for me alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never looked at it like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t promise and wait till I am ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot give you my word to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, looking
thoughtfully down, she gradually moved and moved away, going into the
adjoining room, and closing the door between them.&nbsp; She remained
there in the dark till he was tired of waiting, and had gone up to his
own chamber.</p>
<p>Poor Stockdale was dreadfully depressed all the next day by the discoveries
of the night before.&nbsp; Lizzy was unmistakably a fascinating young
woman, but as a minister&rsquo;s wife she was hardly to be contemplated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I had only stuck to father&rsquo;s little grocery business,
instead of going in for the ministry, she would have suited me beautifully!&rsquo;
he said sadly, until he remembered that in that case he would never
have come from his distant home to Nether-Moynton, and never have known
her.</p>
<p>The estrangement between them was not complete, but it was sufficient
to keep them out of each other&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Once during the
day he met her in the garden-path, and said, turning a reproachful eye
upon her, &lsquo;Do you promise, Lizzy?&rsquo;&nbsp; But she did not
reply.&nbsp; The evening drew on, and he knew well enough that Lizzy
would repeat her excursion at night&mdash;her half-offended manner had
shown that she had not the slightest intention of altering her plans
at present.&nbsp; He did not wish to repeat his own share of the adventure;
but, act as he would, his uneasiness on her account increased with the
decline of day.&nbsp; Supposing that an accident should befall her,
he would never forgive himself for not being there to help, much as
he disliked the idea of seeming to countenance such unlawful escapades.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;HOW THEY WENT TO LULSTEAD COVE</h3>
<p>As he had expected, she left the house at the same hour at night,
this time passing his door without stealth, as if she knew very well
that he would be watching, and were resolved to brave his displeasure.&nbsp;
He was quite ready, opened the door quickly, and reached the back door
almost as soon as she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you will go, Lizzy?&rsquo; he said as he stood on the
step beside her, who now again appeared as a little man with a face
altogether unsuited to his clothes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must,&rsquo; she said, repressed by his stern manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall go too,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am sure you will enjoy it!&rsquo; she exclaimed in more
buoyant tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everybody does who tries it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forbid that I should!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I must look after you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They opened the wicket and went up the road abreast of each other,
but at some distance apart, scarcely a word passing between them.&nbsp;
The evening was rather less favourable to smuggling enterprise than
the last had been, the wind being lower, and the sky somewhat clear
towards the north.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is rather lighter,&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis, unfortunately,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
it is only from those few stars over there.&nbsp; The moon was new to-day
at four o&rsquo;clock, and I expected clouds.&nbsp; I hope we shall
be able to do it this dark, for when we have to sink &rsquo;em for long
it makes the stuff taste bleachy, and folks don&rsquo;t like it so well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her course was different from that of the preceding night, branching
off to the left over Lord&rsquo;s Barrow as soon as they had got out
of the lane and crossed the highway.&nbsp; By the time they reached
Chaldon Down, Stockdale, who had been in perplexed thought as to what
he should say to her, decided that he would not attempt expostulation
now, while she was excited by the adventure, but wait till it was over,
and endeavour to keep her from such practices in future.&nbsp; It occurred
to him once or twice, as they rambled on, that should they be surprised
by the excisemen, his situation would be more awkward than hers, for
it would be difficult to prove his true motive in coming to the spot;
but the risk was a slight consideration beside his wish to be with her.</p>
<p>They now arrived at a ravine which lay on the outskirts of Chaldon,
a village two miles on their way towards the point of the shore they
sought.&nbsp; Lizzy broke the silence this time: &lsquo;I have to wait
here to meet the carriers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if they have come
yet.&nbsp; As I told you, we go to Lulstead Cove to-night, and it is
two miles further than Ringsworth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that the men had already come; for while she spoke
two or three dozen heads broke the line of the slope, and a company
of them at once descended from the bushes where they had been lying
in wait.&nbsp; These carriers were men whom Lizzy and other proprietors
regularly employed to bring the tubs from the boat to a hiding-place
inland.&nbsp; They were all young fellows of Nether-Moynton, Chaldon,
and the neighbourhood, quiet and inoffensive persons, who simply engaged
to carry the cargo for Lizzy and her cousin Owlett, as they would have
engaged in any other labour for which they were fairly well paid.</p>
<p>At a word from her they closed in together.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had
better take it now,&rsquo; she said to them; and handed to each a packet.&nbsp;
It contained six shillings, their remuneration for the night&rsquo;s
undertaking, which was paid beforehand without reference to success
or failure; but, besides this, they had the privilege of selling as
agents when the run was successfully made.&nbsp; As soon as it was done,
she said to them, &lsquo;The place is the old one near Lulstead Cove;&rsquo;
the men till that moment not having been told whither they were bound,
for obvious reasons.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owlett will meet you there,&rsquo;
added Lizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall follow behind, to see that we are
not watched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The carriers went on, and Stockdale and Mrs. Newberry followed at
a distance of a stone&rsquo;s throw.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do these men
do by day?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twelve or fourteen of them are labouring men.&nbsp; Some are
brickmakers, some carpenters, some shoe-makers, some thatchers.&nbsp;
They are all known to me very well.&nbsp; Nine of &rsquo;em are of your
own congregation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I know you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I only told you.&nbsp; The
others are more church-inclined, because they supply the pa&rsquo;son
with all the spirits he requires, and they don&rsquo;t wish to show
unfriendliness to a customer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you choose &rsquo;em?&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We choose &rsquo;em for their closeness, and because they
are strong and surefooted, and able to carry a heavy load a long way
without being tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale sighed as she enumerated each particular, for it proved
how far involved in the business a woman must be who was so well acquainted
with its conditions and needs.&nbsp; And yet he felt more tenderly towards
her at this moment than he had felt all the foregoing day.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was that her experienced manner and hold indifference stirred his
admiration in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take my arm, Lizzy,&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides,
we may never be to each other again what we once have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends upon you,&rsquo; said he, and they went on again
as before.</p>
<p>The hired carriers paced along over Chaldon Down with as little hesitation
as if it had been day, avoiding the cart-way, and leaving the village
of East Chaldon on the left, so as to reach the crest of the hill at
a lonely trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called Round
Pound.&nbsp; An hour&rsquo;s brisk walking brought them within sound
of the sea, not many hundred yards from Lulstead Cove.&nbsp; Here they
paused, and Lizzy and Stockdale came up with them, when they went on
together to the verge of the cliff.&nbsp; One of the men now produced
an iron bar, which he drove firmly into the soil a yard from the edge,
and attached to it a rope that he had uncoiled from his body.&nbsp;
They all began to descend, partly stepping, partly sliding down the
incline, as the rope slipped through their hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not go to the bottom, Lizzy?&rsquo; said Stockdale
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I stay here to watch,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owlett
is down there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men remained quite silent when they reached the shore; and the
next thing audible to the two at the top was the dip of heavy oars,
and the dashing of waves against a boat&rsquo;s bow.&nbsp; In a moment
the keel gently touched the shingle, and Stockdale heard the footsteps
of the thirty-six carriers running forwards over the pebbles towards
the point of landing.</p>
<p>There was a sousing in the water as of a brood of ducks plunging
in, showing that the men had not been particular about keeping their
legs, or even their waists, dry from the brine: but it was impossible
to see what they were doing, and in a few minutes the shingle was trampled
again.&nbsp; The iron bar sustaining the rope, on which Stockdale&rsquo;s
hand rested, began to swerve a little, and the carriers one by one appeared
climbing up the sloping cliff; dripping audibly as they came, and sustaining
themselves by the guide-rope.&nbsp; Each man on reaching the top was
seen to be carrying a pair of tubs, one on his back and one on his chest,
the two being slung together by cords passing round the chine hoops,
and resting on the carrier&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp; Some of the stronger
men carried three by putting an extra one on the top behind, but the
customary load was a pair, these being quite weighty enough to give
their bearer the sensation of having chest and backbone in contact after
a walk of four or five miles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Owlett?&rsquo; said Lizzy to one of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will not come up this way,&rsquo; said the carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s to bide on shore till we be safe off.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then, without waiting for the rest, the foremost men plunged across
the down; and, when the last had ascended, Lizzy pulled up the rope,
wound it round her arm, wriggled the bar from the sod, and turned to
follow the carriers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very anxious about Owlett&rsquo;s safety,&rsquo; said
the minister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there ever such a man!&rsquo; said Lizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
isn&rsquo;t he my cousin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Well, it is a bad night&rsquo;s work,&rsquo; said
Stockdale heavily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll carry the bar and rope
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God, the tubs have got so far all right,&rsquo; said
she.</p>
<p>Stockdale shook his head, and, taking the bar, walked by her side
towards the downs; and the moan of the sea was heard no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this what you meant the other day when you spoke of having
business with Owlett?&rsquo; the young man asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is it,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never see him
on any other matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A partnership of that kind with a young man is very odd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was begun by my father and his, who were brother-laws.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her companion could not blind himself to the fact that where tastes
and pursuits were so akin as Lizzy&rsquo;s and Owlett&rsquo;s, and where
risks were shared, as with them, in every undertaking, there would be
a peculiar appropriateness in her answering Owlett&rsquo;s standing
question on matrimony in the affirmative.&nbsp; This did not soothe
Stockdale, its tendency being rather to stimulate in him an effort to
make the pair as inappropriate as possible, and win her away from this
nocturnal crew to correctness of conduct and a minister&rsquo;s parlour
in some far-removed inland county.</p>
<p>They had been walking near enough to the file of carriers for Stockdale
to perceive that, when they got into the road to the village, they split
up into two companies of unequal size, each of which made off in a direction
of its own.&nbsp; One company, the smaller of the two, went towards
the church, and by the time that Lizzy and Stockdale reached their own
house these men had scaled the churchyard wall, and were proceeding
noiselessly over the grass within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see that Owlett has arranged for one batch to be put in
the church again,&rsquo; observed Lizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you remember
my taking you there the first night you came?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;No wonder
you had permission to broach the tubs&mdash;they were his, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, they were not&mdash;they were mine; I had permission from
myself.&nbsp; The day after that they went several miles inland in a
waggon-load of manure, and sold very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the group of men who had made off to the left some
time before began leaping one by one from the hedge opposite Lizzy&rsquo;s
house, and the first man, who had no tubs upon his shoulders, came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Newberry, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he said hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jim,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find that we can&rsquo;t put any in Badger&rsquo;s Clump
to-night, Lizzy,&rsquo; said Owlett.&nbsp; &lsquo;The place is watched.&nbsp;
We must sling the apple-tree in the orchet if there&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
We can&rsquo;t put any more under the church lumber than I have sent
on there, and my mixen hev already more in en than is safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be quick about it&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; What can I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all, please.&nbsp; Ah, it is the minister!&mdash;you
two that can&rsquo;t do anything had better get indoors and not be zeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Owlett thus conversed, in a tone so full of contraband anxiety
and so free from lover&rsquo;s jealousy, the men who followed him had
been descending one by one from the hedge; and it unfortunately happened
that when the hindmost took his leap, the cord slipped which sustained
his tubs: the result was that both the kegs fell into the road, one
of them being stove in by the blow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Od drown it all!&rsquo; said Owlett, rushing back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is worth a good deal, I suppose?&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;about two guineas and half to us now,&rsquo; said
Lizzy excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t that&mdash;it is the smell!&nbsp;
It is so blazing strong before it has been lowered by water, that it
smells dreadfully when spilt in the road like that!&nbsp; I do hope
Latimer won&rsquo;t pass by till it is gone off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owlett and one or two others picked up the burst tub and began to
scrape and trample over the spot, to disperse the liquor as much as
possible; and then they all entered the gate of Owlett&rsquo;s orchard,
which adjoined Lizzy&rsquo;s garden on the right.&nbsp; Stockdale did
not care to follow them, for several on recognizing him had looked wonderingly
at his presence, though they said nothing.&nbsp; Lizzy left his side
and went to the bottom of the garden, looking over the hedge into the
orchard, where the men could be dimly seen bustling about, and apparently
hiding the tubs.&nbsp; All was done noiselessly, and without a light;
and when it was over they dispersed in different directions, those who
had taken their cargoes to the church having already gone off to their
homes.</p>
<p>Lizzy returned to the garden-gate, over which Stockdale was still
abstractedly leaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is all finished: I am going indoors
now,&rsquo; she said gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will leave the door ajar
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Stockdale; &lsquo;I
am coming too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But before either of them had moved, the faint clatter of horses&rsquo;
hoofs broke upon the ear, and it seemed to come from the point where
the track across the down joined the hard road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are just too late!&rsquo; cried Lizzy exultingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Latimer, the riding-officer, and some assistant of his.&nbsp;
We had better go indoors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They entered the house, and Lizzy bolted the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please
don&rsquo;t get a light, Mr. Stockdale,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I will not,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you might be on the side of the king,&rsquo; said
Lizzy, with faintest sarcasm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, Lizzy Newberry,
I love you, and you know it perfectly well; and you ought to know, if
you do not, what I have suffered in my conscience on your account these
last few days!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guess very well,&rsquo; she said hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet
I don&rsquo;t see why.&nbsp; Ah, you are better than I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trotting of the horses seemed to have again died away, and the
pair of listeners touched each other&rsquo;s fingers in the cold &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo;
of those whom something seriously divided.&nbsp; They were on the landing,
but before they had taken three steps apart, the tramp of the horsemen
suddenly revived, almost close to the house.&nbsp; Lizzy turned to the
staircase window, opened the casement about an inch, and put her face
close to the aperture.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, one of &rsquo;em is Latimer,&rsquo;
she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;He always rides a white horse.&nbsp; One
would think it was the last colour for a man in that line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale looked, and saw the white shape of the animal as it passed
by; but before the riders had gone another ten yards, Latimer reined
in his horse, and said something to his companion which neither Stockdale
nor Lizzy could hear.&nbsp; Its drift was, however, soon made evident,
for the other man stopped also; and sharply turning the horses&rsquo;
heads they cautiously retraced their steps.&nbsp; When they were again
opposite Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s garden, Latimer dismounted, and the man
on the dark horse did the same.</p>
<p>Lizzy and Stockdale, intently listening and observing the proceedings,
naturally put their heads as close as possible to the slit formed by
the slightly opened casement; and thus it occurred that at last their
cheeks came positively into contact.&nbsp; They went on listening, as
if they did not know of the singular incident which had happened to
their faces, and the pressure of each to each rather increased than
lessened with the lapse of time.</p>
<p>They could hear the excisemen sniffing the air like hounds as they
paced slowly along.&nbsp; When they reached the spot where the tub had
burst, both stopped on the instant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, &rsquo;tis quite strong here,&rsquo; said the second
officer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall we knock at the door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; said Latimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Maybe this is
only a trick to put us off the scent.&nbsp; They wouldn&rsquo;t kick
up this stink anywhere near their hiding-place.&nbsp; I have known such
things before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anyhow, the things, or some of &rsquo;em, must have been brought
this way,&rsquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Latimer musingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unless &rsquo;tis
all done to tole us the wrong way.&nbsp; I have a mind that we go home
for to-night without saying a word, and come the first thing in the
morning with more hands.&nbsp; I know they have storages about here,
but we can do nothing by this owl&rsquo;s light.&nbsp; We will look
round the parish and see if everybody is in bed, John; and if all is
quiet, we will do as I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went on, and the two inside the window could hear them passing
leisurely through the whole village, the street of which curved round
at the bottom and entered the turnpike road at another junction.&nbsp;
This way the excisemen followed, and the amble of their horses died
quite away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will you do?&rsquo; said Stockdale, withdrawing from
his position.</p>
<p>She knew that he alluded to the coming search by the officers, to
divert her attention from their own tender incident by the casement,
which he wished to be passed over as a thing rather dreamt of than done.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, nothing,&rsquo; she replied, with as much coolness as she
could command under her disappointment at his manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
often have such storms as this.&nbsp; You would not be frightened if
you knew what fools they are.&nbsp; Fancy riding o&rsquo; horseback
through the place: of course they will hear and see nobody while they
make that noise; but they are always afraid to get off, in case some
of our fellows should burst out upon &rsquo;em, and tie them up to the
gate-post, as they have done before now.&nbsp; Good-night, Mr. Stockdale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She closed the window and went to her room, where a tear fell from
her eyes; and that not because of the alertness of the riding-officers.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE GREAT SEARCH AT NETHER-MOYNTON</h3>
<p>Stockdale was so excited by the events of the evening, and the dilemma
that he was placed in between conscience and love, that he did not sleep,
or even doze, but remained as broadly awake as at noonday.&nbsp; As
soon as the grey light began to touch ever so faintly the whiter objects
in his bedroom he arose, dressed himself, and went downstairs into the
road.</p>
<p>The village was already astir.&nbsp; Several of the carriers had
heard the well-known tramp of Latimer&rsquo;s horse while they were
undressing in the dark that night, and had already communicated with
each other and Owlett on the subject.&nbsp; The only doubt seemed to
be about the safety of those tubs which had been left under the church
gallery-stairs, and after a short discussion at the corner of the mill,
it was agreed that these should be removed before it got lighter, and
hidden in the middle of a double hedge bordering the adjoining field.&nbsp;
However, before anything could be carried into effect, the footsteps
of many men were heard coming down the lane from the highway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn it, here they be,&rsquo; said Owlett, who, having already
drawn the hatch and started his mill for the day, stood stolidly at
the mill-door covered with flour, as if the interest of his whole soul
was bound up in the shaking walls around him.</p>
<p>The two or three with whom he had been talking dispersed to their
usual work, and when the excise officers, and the formidable body of
men they had hired, reached the village cross, between the mill and
Mrs. Newberry&rsquo;s house, the village wore the natural aspect of
a place beginning its morning labours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Latimer to his associates, who numbered thirteen
men in all, &lsquo;what I know is that the things are somewhere in this
here place.&nbsp; We have got the day before us, and &rsquo;tis hard
if we can&rsquo;t light upon &rsquo;em and get &rsquo;em to Budmouth
Custom-house before night.&nbsp; First we will try the fuel-houses,
and then we&rsquo;ll work our way into the chimmers, and then to the
ricks and stables, and so creep round.&nbsp; You have nothing but your
noses to guide ye, mind, so use &rsquo;em to-day if you never did in
your lives before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the search began.&nbsp; Owlett, during the early part, watched
from his mill-window, Lizzy from the door of her house, with the greatest
self-possession.&nbsp; A farmer down below, who also had a share in
the run, rode about with one eye on his fields and the other on Latimer
and his myrmidons, prepared to put them off the scent if he should be
asked a question.&nbsp; Stockdale, who was no smuggler at all, felt
more anxiety than the worst of them, and went about his studies with
a heavy heart, coming frequently to the door to ask Lizzy some question
or other on the consequences to her of the tubs being found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The consequences,&rsquo; she said quietly, &lsquo;are simply
that I shall lose &rsquo;em.&nbsp; As I have none in the house or garden,
they can&rsquo;t touch me personally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you have some in the orchard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owlett rents that of me, and he lends it to others.&nbsp;
So it will be hard to say who put any tubs there if they should be found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was never such a tremendous sniffing known as that which took
place in Nether-Moynton parish and its vicinity this day.&nbsp; All
was done methodically, and mostly on hands and knees.&nbsp; At different
hours of the day they had different plans.&nbsp; From daybreak to breakfast-time
the officers used their sense of smell in a direct and straightforward
manner only, pausing nowhere but at such places as the tubs might be
supposed to be secreted in at that very moment, pending their removal
on the following night.&nbsp; Among the places tested and examined were</p>
<pre>Hollow trees        Cupboards         Culverts
Potato-graves       Clock-cases       Hedgerows
Fuel-houses         Chimney-flues     Faggot-ricks
Bedrooms            Rainwater-butts   Haystacks
Apple-lofts         Pigsties          Coppers and ovens.</pre>
<p>After breakfast they recommenced with renewed vigour, taking a new
line; that is to say, directing their attention to clothes that might
be supposed to have come in contact with the tubs in their removal from
the shore, such garments being usually tainted with the spirit, owing
to its oozing between the staves.&nbsp; They now sniffed at -</p>
<pre>Smock-frocks                 Smiths&rsquo; and shoemakers&rsquo; aprons
Old shirts and waistcoats    Knee-naps and hedging-gloves
Coats and hats               Tarpaulins
Breeches and leggings        Market-cloaks
Women&rsquo;s shawls and gowns     Scarecrows</pre>
<p>And as soon as the mid-day meal was over, they pushed their search
into places where the spirits might have been thrown away in alarm:-</p>
<pre>Horse-ponds       Mixens         Sinks in yards
Stable-drains     Wet ditches    Road-scrapings, and
Cinder-heaps      Cesspools      Back-door gutters.</pre>
<p>But still these indefatigable excisemen discovered nothing more than
the original tell-tale smell in the road opposite Lizzy&rsquo;s house,
which even yet had not passed off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what it is, men,&rsquo; said Latimer, about
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, &lsquo;we must begin over again.&nbsp;
Find them tubs I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men, who had been hired for the day, looked at their hands and
knees, muddy with creeping on all fours so frequently, and rubbed their
noses, as if they had almost had enough of it; for the quantity of bad
air which had passed into each one&rsquo;s nostril had rendered it nearly
as insensible as a flue.&nbsp; However, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
they prepared to start anew, except three, whose power of smell had
quite succumbed under the excessive wear and tear of the day.</p>
<p>By this time not a male villager was to be seen in the parish.&nbsp;
Owlett was not at his mill, the farmers were not in their fields, the
parson was not in his garden, the smith had left his forge, and the
wheelwright&rsquo;s shop was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where the divil are the folk gone?&rsquo; said Latimer, waking
up to the fact of their absence, and looking round.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
have &rsquo;em up for this!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t they come and help
us?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a man about the place but the Methodist
parson, and he&rsquo;s an old woman.&nbsp; I demand assistance in the
king&rsquo;s name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must find the jineral public afore we can demand that,&rsquo;
said his lieutenant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, we shall do better without &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said
Latimer, who changed his moods at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
there&rsquo;s great cause of suspicion in this silence and this keeping
out of sight, and I&rsquo;ll bear it in mind.&nbsp; Now we will go across
to Owlett&rsquo;s orchard, and see what we can find there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale, who heard this discussion from the garden-gate, over which
he had been leaning, was rather alarmed, and thought it a mistake of
the villagers to keep so completely out of the way.&nbsp; He himself,
like the excisemen, had been wondering for the last half-hour what could
have become of them.&nbsp; Some labourers were of necessity engaged
in distant fields, but the master-workmen should have been at home;
though one and all, after just showing themselves at their shops, had
apparently gone off for the day.&nbsp; He went in to Lizzy, who sat
at a back window sewing, and said, &lsquo;Lizzy, where are the men?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where they mostly are when they&rsquo;re
run so hard as this.&rsquo;&nbsp; She cast her eyes to heaven.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Up there,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Stockdale looked up.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&mdash;on the top of the church
tower?&rsquo; he asked, seeing the direction of her glance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I expect they will soon have to come down,&rsquo; said
he gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been listening to the officers, and
they are going to search the orchard over again, and then every nook
in the church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy looked alarmed for the first time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you go
and tell our folk?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They ought to be let
know.&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing his conscience struggling within him like
a boiling pot, she added, &lsquo;No, never mind, I&rsquo;ll go myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went out, descended the garden, and climbed over the churchyard
wall at the same time that the preventive-men were ascending the road
to the orchard.&nbsp; Stockdale could do no less than follow her.&nbsp;
By the time that she reached the tower entrance he was at her side,
and they entered together.</p>
<p>Nether-Moynton church-tower was, as in many villages, without a turret,
and the only way to the top was by going up to the singers&rsquo; gallery,
and thence ascending by a ladder to a square trap-door in the floor
of the bell-loft, above which a permanent ladder was fixed, passing
through the bells to a hole in the roof.&nbsp; When Lizzy and Stockdale
reached the gallery and looked up, nothing but the trap-door and the
five holes for the bell-ropes appeared.&nbsp; The ladder was gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no getting up,&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, there is,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
an eye looking at us at this moment through a knot-hole in that trap-door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as she spoke the trap opened, and the dark line of the ladder
was seen descending against the white-washed wall.&nbsp; When it touched
the bottom Lizzy dragged it to its place, and said, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll
go up, I&rsquo;ll follow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man ascended, and presently found himself among consecrated
bells for the first time in his life, nonconformity having been in the
Stockdale blood for some generations.&nbsp; He eyed them uneasily, and
looked round for Lizzy.&nbsp; Owlett stood here, holding the top of
the ladder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, be you really one of us?&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems so,&rsquo; said Stockdale sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not,&rsquo; said Lizzy, who overheard.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
neither for nor against us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do us no harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stepped up beside them, and then they went on to the next stage,
which, when they had clambered over the dusty bell-carriages, was of
easy ascent, leading towards the hole through which the pale sky appeared,
and into the open air.&nbsp; Owlett remained behind for a moment, to
pull up the lower ladder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep down your heads,&rsquo; said a voice, as soon as they
set foot on the flat.</p>
<p>Stockdale here beheld all the missing parishioners, lying on their
stomachs on the tower roof, except a few who, elevated on their hands
and knees, were peeping through the embrasures of the parapet.&nbsp;
Stockdale did the same, and saw the village lying like a map below him,
over which moved the figures of the excisemen, each foreshortened to
a crablike object, the crown of his hat forming a circular disc in the
centre of him.&nbsp; Some of the men had turned their heads when the
young preacher&rsquo;s figure arose among them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, Mr. Stockdale?&rsquo; said Matt Grey, in a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d as lief that it hadn&rsquo;t been,&rsquo; said Jim
Clarke.&nbsp; &lsquo;If the pa&rsquo;son should see him a trespassing
here in his tower, &rsquo;twould be none the better for we, seeing how
&rsquo;a do hate chapel-members.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d never buy a tub of
us again, and he&rsquo;s as good a customer as we have got this side
o&rsquo; Warm&rsquo;ll.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the pa&rsquo;son?&rsquo; said Lizzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In his house, to be sure, that he mid see nothing of what&rsquo;s
going on&mdash;where all good folks ought to be, and this young man
likewise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he has brought some news,&rsquo; said Lizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
are going to search the orchet and church; can we do anything if they
should find?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said her cousin Owlett.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve been talking o&rsquo;, and we have settled our line.&nbsp;
Well, be dazed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation was caused by his perceiving that some of the searchers,
having got into the orchard, and begun stooping and creeping hither
and thither, were pausing in the middle, where a tree smaller than the
rest was growing.&nbsp; They drew closer, and bent lower than ever upon
the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my tubs!&rsquo; said Lizzy faintly, as she peered through
the parapet at them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have got &rsquo;em, &rsquo;a b&rsquo;lieve,&rsquo; said
Owlett.</p>
<p>The interest in the movements of the officers was so keen that not
a single eye was looking in any other direction; but at that moment
a shout from the church beneath them attracted the attention of the
smugglers, as it did also of the party in the orchard, who sprang to
their feet and went towards the churchyard wall.&nbsp; At the same time
those of the Government men who had entered the church unperceived by
the smugglers cried aloud, &lsquo;Here be some of &rsquo;em at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The smugglers remained in a blank silence, uncertain whether &lsquo;some
of &rsquo;em&rsquo; meant tubs or men; but again peeping cautiously
over the edge of the tower they learnt that tubs were the things descried;
and soon these fated articles were brought one by one into the middle
of the churchyard from their hiding-place under the gallery-stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are going to put &rsquo;em on Hinton&rsquo;s vault till
they find the rest!&rsquo; said Lizzy hopelessly.&nbsp; The excisemen
had, in fact, begun to pile up the tubs on a large stone slab which
was fixed there; and when all were brought out from the tower, two or
three of the men were left standing by them, the rest of the party again
proceeding to the orchard.</p>
<p>The interest of the smugglers in the next manoeuvres of their enemies
became painfully intense.&nbsp; Only about thirty tubs had been secreted
in the lumber of the tower, but seventy were hidden in the orchard,
making up all that they had brought ashore as yet, the remainder of
the cargo having been tied to a sinker and dropped overboard for another
night&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp; The excisemen, having re-entered the
orchard, acted as if they were positive that here lay hidden the rest
of the tubs, which they were determined to find before nightfall.&nbsp;
They spread themselves out round the field, and advancing on all fours
as before, went anew round every apple-tree in the enclosure.&nbsp;
The young tree in the middle again led them to pause, and at length
the whole company gathered there in a way which signified that a second
chain of reasoning had led to the same results as the first.</p>
<p>When they had examined the sod hereabouts for some minutes, one of
the men rose, ran to a disused porch of the church where tools were
kept, and returned with the sexton&rsquo;s pickaxe and shovel, with
which they set to work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they really buried there?&rsquo; said the minister, for
the grass was so green and uninjured that it was difficult to believe
it had been disturbed.&nbsp; The smugglers were too interested to reply,
and presently they saw, to their chagrin, the officers stand several
on each side of the tree; and, stooping and applying their hands to
the soil, they bodily lifted the tree and the turf around it.&nbsp;
The apple-tree now showed itself to be growing in a shallow box, with
handles for lifting at each of the four sides.&nbsp; Under the site
of the tree a square hole was revealed, and an exciseman went and looked
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all up now,&rsquo; said Owlett quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
now all of ye get down before they notice we are here; and be ready
for our next move.&nbsp; I had better bide here till dark, or they may
take me on suspicion, as &rsquo;tis on my ground.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
with ye as soon as daylight begins to pink in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I?&rsquo; said Lizzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You please look to the linch-pins and screws; then go indoors
and know nothing at all.&nbsp; The chaps will do the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ladder was replaced, and all but Owlett descended, the men passing
off one by one at the back of the church, and vanishing on their respective
errands.</p>
<p>Lizzy walked boldly along the street, followed closely by the minister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going indoors, Mrs. Newberry?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She knew from the words &lsquo;Mrs. Newberry&rsquo; that the division
between them had widened yet another degree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going home,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
a little thing to do before I go in.&nbsp; Martha Sarah will get your
tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mean on that account,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What <i>can</i> you have to do further in this unhallowed affair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a little,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I shall go by myself.&nbsp; Will you please go indoors?&nbsp;
I shall be there in less than an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not going to run any danger, Lizzy?&rsquo; said the
young man, his tenderness reasserting itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None whatever&mdash;worth mentioning,&rsquo; answered she,
and went down towards the Cross.</p>
<p>Stockdale entered the garden gate, and stood behind it looking on.&nbsp;
The excisemen were still busy in the orchard, and at last he was tempted
to enter, and watch their proceedings.&nbsp; When he came closer he
found that the secret cellar, of whose existence he had been totally
unaware, was formed by timbers placed across from side to side about
a foot under the ground, and grassed over.</p>
<p>The excisemen looked up at Stockdale&rsquo;s fair and downy countenance,
and evidently thinking him above suspicion, went on with their work
again.&nbsp; As soon as all the tubs were taken out, they began tearing
up the turf; pulling out the timbers, and breaking in the sides, till
the cellar was wholly dismantled and shapeless, the apple-tree lying
with its roots high to the air.&nbsp; But the hole which had in its
time held so much contraband merchandize was never completely filled
up, either then or afterwards, a depression in the greensward marking
the spot to this day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE WALK TO WARM&rsquo;ELL CROSS AND AFTERWARDS</h3>
<p>As the goods had all to be carried to Budmouth that night, the excisemen&rsquo;s
next object was to find horses and carts for the journey, and they went
about the village for that purpose.&nbsp; Latimer strode hither and
thither with a lump of chalk in his hand, marking broad-arrows so vigorously
on every vehicle and set of harness that he came across, that it seemed
as if he would chalk broad-arrows on the very hedges and roads.&nbsp;
The owner of every conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for
Government purposes.&nbsp; Stockdale, who had had enough of the scene,
turned indoors thoughtful and depressed.&nbsp; Lizzy was already there,
having come in at the back, though she had not yet taken off her bonnet.&nbsp;
She looked tired, and her mood was not much brighter than his own.&nbsp;
They had but little to say to each other; and the minister went away
and attempted to read; but at this he could not succeed, and he shook
the little bell for tea.</p>
<p>Lizzy herself brought in the tray, the girl having run off into the
village during the afternoon, too full of excitement at the proceedings
to remember her state of life.&nbsp; However, almost before the sad
lovers had said anything to each other, Martha came in in a steaming
state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, there&rsquo;s such a stoor, Mrs. Newberry and Mr. Stockdale!&nbsp;
The king&rsquo;s excisemen can&rsquo;t get the carts ready nohow at
all!&nbsp; They pulled Thomas Ballam&rsquo;s, and William Rogers&rsquo;s,
and Stephen Sprake&rsquo;s carts into the road, and off came the wheels,
and down fell the carts; and they found there was no linch-pins in the
arms; and then they tried Samuel Shane&rsquo;s waggon, and found that
the screws were gone from he, and at last they looked at the dairyman&rsquo;s
cart, and he&rsquo;s got none neither!&nbsp; They have gone now to the
blacksmith&rsquo;s to get some made, but he&rsquo;s nowhere to be found!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale looked at Lizzy, who blushed very slightly, and went out
of the room, followed by Martha Sarah.&nbsp; But before they had got
through the passage there was a rap at the front door, and Stockdale
recognized Latimer&rsquo;s voice addressing Mrs. Newberry, who had turned
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Mrs. Newberry, have you seen Hardman
the blacksmith up this way?&nbsp; If we could get hold of him, we&rsquo;d
e&rsquo;en a&rsquo;most drag him by the hair of his head to his anvil,
where he ought to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s an idle man, Mr. Latimer,&rsquo; said Lizzy archly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you want him for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t a horse in the place that has got more
than three shoes on, and some have only two.&nbsp; The waggon-wheels
be without strakes, and there&rsquo;s no linch-pins to the carts.&nbsp;
What with that, and the bother about every set of harness being out
of order, we shan&rsquo;t be off before nightfall&mdash;upon my soul
we shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a rough lot, Mrs. Newberry, that you&rsquo;ve
got about you here; but they&rsquo;ll play at this game once too often,
mark my words they will!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a man in the parish
that don&rsquo;t deserve to be whipped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It happened that Hardman was at that moment a little further up the
lane, smoking his pipe behind a holly-bush.&nbsp; When Latimer had done
speaking he went on in this direction, and Hardman, hearing the exciseman&rsquo;s
steps, found curiosity too strong for prudence.&nbsp; He peeped out
from the bush at the very moment that Latimer&rsquo;s glance was on
it.&nbsp; There was nothing left for him to do but to come forward with
unconcern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for the last hour!&rsquo;
said Latimer with a glare in his eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry to hear that,&rsquo; said Hardman.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
been out for a stroll, to look for more hid tubs, to deliver &rsquo;em
up to Gover&rsquo;ment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, Hardman, we know it,&rsquo; said Latimer, with withering
sarcasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;We know that you&rsquo;ll deliver &rsquo;em up
to Gover&rsquo;ment.&nbsp; We know that all the parish is helping us,
and have been all day!&nbsp; Now you please walk along with me down
to your shop, and kindly let me hire ye in the king&rsquo;s name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went down the lane together; and presently there resounded from
the smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung.&nbsp; However,
the carts and horses were got into some sort of travelling condition,
but it was not until after the clock had struck six, when the muddy
roads were glistening under the horizontal light of the fading day.&nbsp;
The smuggled tubs were soon packed into the vehicles, and Latimer, with
three of his assistants, drove slowly out of the village in the direction
of the port of Budmouth, some considerable number of miles distant,
the other excisemen being left to watch for the remainder of the cargo,
which they knew to have been sunk somewhere between Ringsworth and Lulstead
Cove, and to unearth Owlett, the only person clearly implicated by the
discovery of the cave.</p>
<p>Women and children stood at the doors as the carts, each chalked
with the Government pitchfork, passed in the increasing twilight; and
as they stood they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy
expression that told only too plainly the relation which they bore to
the trade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Lizzy,&rsquo; said Stockdale, when the crackle of the
wheels had nearly died away.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a fit finish to your
adventure.&nbsp; I am truly thankful that you have got off without suspicion,
and the loss only of the liquor.&nbsp; Will you sit down and let me
talk to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By and by,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I must go out
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to that horrid shore again?&rsquo; he said blankly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not there.&nbsp; I am only going to see the end of this
day&rsquo;s business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer to this, and she moved towards the door slowly,
as if waiting for him to say something more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t offer to come with me,&rsquo; she added at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s because you hate me after
all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you say it, Lizzy, when you know I only want to save you
from such practices?&nbsp; Come with you of course I will, if it is
only to take care of you.&nbsp; But why will you go out again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I cannot rest indoors.&nbsp; Something is happening,
and I must know what.&nbsp; Now, come!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they went into
the dusk together.</p>
<p>When they reached the turnpike-road she turned to the right, and
he soon perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen
and their load.&nbsp; He had given her his arm, and every now and then
she suddenly pulled it back, to signify that he was to halt a moment
and listen.&nbsp; They had walked rather quickly along the first quarter
of a mile, and on the second or third time of standing still she said,
&lsquo;I hear them ahead&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I hear the wheels.&nbsp; But what
of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only want to know if they get clear away from the neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he, a light breaking upon him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something
desperate is to be attempted!&mdash;and now I remember there was not
a man about the village when we left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp; The noise of the cartwheels
had stopped, and given place to another sort of sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a scuffle!&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll
be murder!&nbsp; Lizzy, let go my arm; I am going on.&nbsp; On my conscience,
I must not stay here and do nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be no murder, and not even a broken head,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our men are thirty to four of them: no harm will
be done at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there <i>is</i> an attack!&rsquo; exclaimed Stockdale;
&lsquo;and you knew it was to be.&nbsp; Why should you side with men
who break the laws like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you side with men who take from country traders
what they have honestly bought wi&rsquo; their own money in France?&rsquo;
said she firmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not honestly bought,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are,&rsquo; she contradicted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I and Owlett
and the others paid thirty shillings for every one of the tubs before
they were put on board at Cherbourg, and if a king who is nothing to
us sends his people to steal our property, we have a right to steal
it back again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale did not stop to argue the matter, but went quickly in the
direction of the noise, Lizzy keeping at his side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
you interfere, will you, dear Richard?&rsquo; she said anxiously, as
they drew near.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us go any closer: &rsquo;tis
at Warm&rsquo;ell Cross where they are seizing &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You
can do no good, and you may meet with a hard blow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us see first what is going on,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; But
before they had got much further the noise of the cartwheels began again;
and Stockdale soon found that they were coming towards him.&nbsp; In
another minute the three carts came up, and Stockdale and Lizzy stood
in the ditch to let them pass.</p>
<p>Instead of being conducted by four men, as had happened when they
went out of the village, the horses and carts were now accompanied by
a body of from twenty to thirty, all of whom, as Stockdale perceived
to his astonishment, had blackened faces.&nbsp; Among them walked six
or eight huge female figures, whom, from their wide strides, Stockdale
guessed to be men in disguise.&nbsp; As soon as the party discerned
Lizzy and her companion four or five fell back, and when the carts had
passed, came close to the pair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no walking up this way for the present,&rsquo; said
one of the gaunt women, who wore curls a foot long, dangling down the
sides of her face, in the fashion of the time.&nbsp; Stockdale recognized
this lady&rsquo;s voice as Owlett&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the public
highway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now look here, youngster,&rsquo; said Owlett.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
&rsquo;tis the Methodist parson!&mdash;what, and Mrs. Newberry!&nbsp;
Well, you&rsquo;d better not go up that way, Lizzy.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
all run off, and folks have got their own again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller then hastened on and joined his comrades.&nbsp; Stockdale
and Lizzy also turned back.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish all this hadn&rsquo;t
been forced upon us,&rsquo; she said regretfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if
those excisemen had got off with the tubs, half the people in the parish
would have been in want for the next month or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale was not paying much attention to her words, and he said,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can go back like this.&nbsp; Those four
poor excisemen may be murdered for all I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Murdered!&rsquo; said Lizzy impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t
do murder here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall go as far as Warm&rsquo;ell Cross to see,&rsquo;
said Stockdale decisively; and, without wishing her safe home or anything
else, the minister turned back.&nbsp; Lizzy stood looking at him till
his form was absorbed in the shades; and then, with sadness, she went
in the direction of Nether-Moynton.</p>
<p>The road was lonely, and after nightfall at this time of the year
there was often not a passer for hours.&nbsp; Stockdale pursued his
way without hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps; and in
due time he passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded
the Warm&rsquo;ell Cross-road.&nbsp; Before he had reached the point
of intersection he heard voices from the thicket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoi-hoi-hoi!&nbsp; Help, help!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voices were not at all feeble or despairing, but they were unmistakably
anxious.&nbsp; Stockdale had no weapon, and before plunging into the
pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge,
to use in case of need.&nbsp; When he got among the trees he shouted&mdash;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter&mdash;where are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; answered the voices; and, pushing through the
brambles in that direction, he came near the objects of his search.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come forward?&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We be tied to the trees!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Will Latimer the exciseman!&rsquo; said one plaintively.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just come and cut these cords, there&rsquo;s a good man.&nbsp;
We were afraid nobody would pass by to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale soon loosened them, upon which they stretched their limbs
and stood at their ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rascals!&rsquo; said Latimer, getting now into a rage,
though he had seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the same set of fellows.&nbsp; I know they were Moynton
chaps to a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we can&rsquo;t swear to &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not one of &rsquo;em spoke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; said Stockdale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d fain go back to Moynton, and have at &rsquo;em again!&rsquo;
said Latimer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So would we!&rsquo; said his comrades.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fight till we die!&rsquo; said Latimer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will, we will!&rsquo; said his men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Latimer, more frigidly, as they came out
of the plantation, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> that these chaps
with black faces were Moynton men?&nbsp; And proof is a hard thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And therefore we won&rsquo;t do nothing at all,&rsquo; said
Latimer, with complete dispassionateness.&nbsp; &lsquo;For my part,
I&rsquo;d sooner be them than we.&nbsp; The clitches of my arms are
burning like fire from the cords those two strapping women tied round
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; My opinion is, now I have had time to think o&rsquo;t,
that you may serve your Gover&rsquo;ment at too high a price.&nbsp;
For these two nights and days I have not had an hour&rsquo;s rest; and,
please God, here&rsquo;s for home-along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other officers agreed heartily to this course; and, thanking
Stockdale for his timely assistance, they parted from him at the Cross,
taking themselves the western road, and Stockdale going back to Nether-Moynton.</p>
<p>During that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful
kind.&nbsp; As soon as he got into the house, and before entering his
own rooms, he advanced to the door of the little back parlour in which
Lizzy usually sat with her mother.&nbsp; He found her there alone.&nbsp;
Stockdale went forward, and, like a man in a dream, looked down upon
the table that stood between him and the young woman, who had her bonnet
and cloak still on.&nbsp; As he did not speak, she looked up from her
chair at him, with misgiving in her eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are they gone?&rsquo; he then said listlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I have seen nothing of
them since.&nbsp; I came straight in here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If your men can manage to get off with those tubs, it will
be a great profit to you, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A share will be mine, a share my cousin Owlett&rsquo;s, a
share to each of the two farmers, and a share divided amongst the men
who helped us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you still think,&rsquo; he went on slowly, &lsquo;that
you will not give this business up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy rose, and put her hand upon his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
ask that,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what
you are asking.&nbsp; I must tell you, though I meant not to do it.&nbsp;
What I make by that trade is all I have to keep my mother and myself
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was astonished.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not dream of such a thing,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would rather have swept the streets, had I been
you.&nbsp; What is money compared with a clear conscience?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My conscience is clear.&nbsp; I know my mother, but the king
I have never seen.&nbsp; His dues are nothing to me.&nbsp; But it is
a great deal to me that my mother and I should live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marry me, and promise to give it up.&nbsp; I will keep your
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is good of you,&rsquo; she said, trembling a little.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let me think of it by myself.&nbsp; I would rather not answer
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She reserved her answer till the next day, and came into his room
with a solemn face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot do what you wished!&rsquo;
she said passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is too much to ask.&nbsp; My
whole life ha&rsquo; been passed in this way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her words
and manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with
herself in private, and that the contention had been strong.</p>
<p>Stockdale turned pale, but he spoke quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, Lizzy,
we must part.&nbsp; I cannot go against my principles in this matter,
and I cannot make my profession a mockery.&nbsp; You know how I love
you, and what I would do for you; but this one thing I cannot do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should you belong to that profession?&rsquo; she burst
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have got this large house; why can&rsquo;t you marry
me, and live here with us, and not be a Methodist preacher any more?&nbsp;
I assure you, Richard, it is no harm, and I wish you could only see
it as I do!&nbsp; We only carry it on in winter: in summer it is never
done at all.&nbsp; It stirs up one&rsquo;s dull life at this time o&rsquo;
the year, and gives excitement, which I have got so used to now that
I should hardly know how to do &lsquo;ithout it.&nbsp; At nights, when
the wind blows, instead of being dull and stupid, and not noticing whether
it do blow or not, your mind is afield, even if you are not afield yourself;
and you are wondering how the chaps are getting on; and you walk up
and down the room, and look out o&rsquo; window, and then you go out
yourself, and know your way about as well by night as by day, and have
hairbreadth escapes from old Latimer and his fellows, who are too stupid
ever to really frighten us, and only make us a bit nimble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He frightened you a little last night, anyhow: and I would
advise you to drop it before it is worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I must go on as I have begun.&nbsp;
I was born to it.&nbsp; It is in my blood, and I can&rsquo;t be cured.&nbsp;
O, Richard, you cannot think what a hard thing you have asked, and how
sharp you try me when you put me between this and my love for &lsquo;ee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantelpiece, his hands
over his eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;We ought never to have met, Lizzy,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was an ill day for us!&nbsp; I little thought
there was anything so hopeless and impossible in our engagement as this.&nbsp;
Well, it is too late now to regret consequences in this way.&nbsp; I
have had the happiness of seeing you and knowing you at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You dissent from Church, and I dissent from State,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t see why we are not well matched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled sadly, while Lizzy remained looking down, her eyes beginning
to overflow.</p>
<p>That was an unhappy evening for both of them, and the days that followed
were unhappy days.&nbsp; Both she and he went mechanically about their
employments, and his depression was marked in the village by more than
one of his denomination with whom he came in contact.&nbsp; But Lizzy,
who passed her days indoors, was unsuspected of being the cause: for
it was generally understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed
between her and her cousin Owlett, and had existed for some time.</p>
<p>Thus uncertainly the week passed on; till one morning Stockdale said
to her: &lsquo;I have had a letter, Lizzy.&nbsp; I must call you that
till I am gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone?&rsquo; said she blankly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going from this place.&nbsp;
I felt it would be better for us both that I should not stay after what
has happened.&nbsp; In fact, I couldn&rsquo;t stay here, and look on
you from day to day, without becoming weak and faltering in my course.&nbsp;
I have just heard of an arrangement by which the other minister can
arrive here in about a week; and let me go elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution
came upon her as a grievous surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;You never loved me!&rsquo;
she said bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might say the same,&rsquo; he returned; &lsquo;but I will
not.&nbsp; Grant me one favour.&nbsp; Come and hear my last sermon on
the day before I go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lizzy, who was a church-goer on Sunday mornings, frequently attended
Stockdale&rsquo;s chapel in the evening with the rest of the double-minded;
and she promised.</p>
<p>It became known that Stockdale was going to leave, and a good many
people outside his own sect were sorry to hear it.&nbsp; The intervening
days flew rapidly away, and on the evening of the Sunday which preceded
the morning of his departure Lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for
the last time.&nbsp; The little building was full to overflowing, and
he took up the subject which all had expected, that of the contraband
trade so extensively practised among them.&nbsp; His hearers, in laying
his words to their own hearts, did not perceive that they were most
particularly directed against Lizzy, till the sermon waxed warm, and
Stockdale nearly broke down with emotion.&nbsp; In truth his own earnestness,
and her sad eyes looking up at him, were too much for the young man&rsquo;s
equanimity.&nbsp; He hardly knew how he ended.&nbsp; He saw Lizzy, as
through a mist, turn and go away with the rest of the congregation;
and shortly afterwards followed her home.</p>
<p>She invited him to supper, and they sat down alone, her mother having,
as was usual with her on Sunday nights, gone to bed early.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will part friends, won&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; said Lizzy, with
forced gaiety, and never alluding to the sermon: a reticence which rather
disappointed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will,&rsquo; he said, with a forced smile on his part;
and they sat down.</p>
<p>It was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their
lives, and probably the last that they would so share.&nbsp; When it
was over, and the indifferent conversation could no longer be continued,
he arose and took her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lizzy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;do
you say we must part&mdash;do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do,&rsquo; she said solemnly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can say no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that is your answer,
good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale bent over her and kissed her, and she involuntarily returned
his kiss.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall go early,&rsquo; he said hurriedly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall not see you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he did leave early.&nbsp; He fancied, when stepping forth into
the grey morning light, to mount the van which was to carry him away,
that he saw a face between the parted curtains of Lizzy&rsquo;s window,
but the light was faint, and the panes glistened with wet; so he could
not be sure.&nbsp; Stockdale mounted the vehicle, and was gone; and
on the following Sunday the new minister preached in the chapel of the
Moynton Wesleyans.</p>
<p>One day, two years after the parting, Stockdale, now settled in a
midland town, came into Nether-Moynton by carrier in the original way.&nbsp;
Jogging along in the van that afternoon he had put questions to the
driver, and the answers that he received interested the minister deeply.&nbsp;
The result of them was that he went without the least hesitation to
the door of his former lodging.&nbsp; It was about six o&rsquo;clock
in the evening, and the same time of year as when he had left; now,
too, the ground was damp and glistening, the west was bright, and Lizzy&rsquo;s
snowdrops were raising their heads in the border under the wall.</p>
<p>Lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window, for by the time
that he reached the door she was there holding it open: and then, as
if she had not sufficiently considered her act of coming out, she drew
herself back, saying with some constraint, &lsquo;Mr. Stockdale!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You knew it was,&rsquo; said Stockdale, taking her hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wrote to say I should call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but you did not say when,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not.&nbsp; I was not quite sure when my business would
lead me to these parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You only came because business brought you near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that is the fact; but I have often thought I should
like to come on purpose to see you . . . But what&rsquo;s all this that
has happened?&nbsp; I told you how it would be, Lizzy, and you would
not listen to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not,&rsquo; she said sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I had
been brought up to that life; and it was second nature to me.&nbsp;
However, it is all over now.&nbsp; The officers have blood-money for
taking a man dead or alive, and the trade is going to nothing.&nbsp;
We were hunted down like rats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owlett is quite gone, I hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; He is in America.&nbsp; We had a dreadful struggle
that last time, when they tried to take him.&nbsp; It is a perfect miracle
that he lived through it; and it is a wonder that I was not killed.&nbsp;
I was shot in the hand.&nbsp; It was not by aim; the shot was really
meant for my cousin; but I was behind, looking on as usual, and the
bullet came to me.&nbsp; It bled terribly, but I got home without fainting;
and it healed after a time.&nbsp; You know how he suffered?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Stockdale.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only heard that
he just escaped with his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was shot in the back; but a rib turned the ball.&nbsp;
He was badly hurt.&nbsp; We would not let him be took.&nbsp; The men
carried him all night across the meads to Kingsbere, and hid him in
a barn, dressing his wound as well as they could, till he was so far
recovered as to be able to get about.&nbsp; He had gied up his mill
for some time; and at last he got to Bristol, and took a passage to
America, and he&rsquo;s settled in Wisconsin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of smuggling now?&rsquo; said the minister
gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I own that we were wrong,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I have suffered for it.&nbsp; I am very poor now, and my mother has
been dead these twelve months . . . But won&rsquo;t you come in, Mr.
Stockdale?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stockdale went in; and it is to be supposed that they came to an
understanding; for a fortnight later there was a sale of Lizzy&rsquo;s
furniture, and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighbouring town.</p>
<p>He took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made
for himself in his native county, where she studied her duties as a
minister&rsquo;s wife with praiseworthy assiduity.&nbsp; It is said
that in after years she wrote an excellent tract called <i>Render unto
Caesar; or, The Repentant Villagers</i>, in which her own experience
was anonymously used as the introductory story.&nbsp; Stockdale got
it printed, after making some corrections, and putting in a few powerful
sentences of his own; and many hundreds of copies were distributed by
the couple in the course of their married life.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 1879.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
